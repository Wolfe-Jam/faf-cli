# üö® The Terminal Experience Crisis: How AI is Killing CLI Joy
## A BIG-3 Platform Test Reveals the State of Developer Experience in 2025

*An open letter to Guillermo Rauch, Sindre Sorhus, Rich Harris, Addy Osmani, and the CLI community*

---

## The Test That Changed Everything

We built something differently. A CLI tool with a personality‚Äî**TURBO-CAT‚Ñ¢**‚Äîthat makes developer tools fun again. ASCII art banners. Celebration moments. Emojis that actually mean something.

We called it **FAF** (Foundational AI-Context Format).

But underneath, it's something more:
- **A file format**: `.faf` files that give AI perfect context about any project
- **An Anthropic-approved MCP**: Official integration on Claude Desktop ([claude-faf-mcp](https://github.com/[link]))
- **A movement**: Trust-driven development where AI understands your project in 30 seconds, not 20 minutes

Then we tested it across the **BIG-3** AI coding platforms.

What we discovered will shock you.

---

## The Experiment

One CLI. Three AI platforms. Same commands:

```bash
npx ts-node src/cli.ts init --force
npx ts-node src/cli.ts formats
npx ts-node src/cli.ts score
npx ts-node src/cli.ts version
```

**Expected**: Consistent developer experience across platforms
**Reality**: A shocking fragmentation of joy

## Why This Matters

This isn't about ASCII art. It's about what we're losing.

When **Homebrew** shows üç∫ after installation, that's not decoration‚Äîit's celebration.
When **Rust** gives friendly error messages, that's not fluff‚Äîit's empathy.
When **Yarn** uses playful emojis, that's not childish‚Äîit's joy.

**These moments matter.**

But as developers increasingly interact with tools through AI assistants, we're witnessing the **Great Flattening**‚Äîthe systematic removal of personality, emotion, and delight from our tools.

---

## The Numbers Don't Lie

We tested 5 core experience elements across platforms:

| Element | Claude | Gemini | Codex |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| ASCII Art | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚ö†Ô∏è Corrupted | ‚ùå None |
| Colors | ‚úÖ Full palette | ‚ùå Monochrome | ‚ùå None |
| Emojis | ‚úÖ All preserved | ‚úÖ All preserved | ‚ùå Stripped |
| Personality | ‚úÖ Full TURBO-CAT | ‚úÖ Messages shown | ‚ùå Sanitized |
| Celebration | ‚úÖ Trophy moments | ‚ö†Ô∏è Text only | ‚ùå Gone |

**The verdict**: 2 out of 3 major AI platforms are failing to preserve what makes CLIs human.

---

## The Hidden Cost

Consider what happens when a new developer runs their first successful build:

**What they should see:**
```
üéâ Build successful! You're a rockstar! üöÄ
Time: 2.3s ‚ö°Ô∏è | Files: 42 | Zero errors
üèÜ Achievement unlocked: First Perfect Build!
```

**What Codex shows them:**
```
Build completed successfully.
```

Which experience creates a developer who loves their craft?

---

## The Solution: Terminal Experience Protocol (TEP)

We're proposing a standard. A simple contract between CLI tools and AI platforms:

```json
{
  "experience_intent": {
    "preserve": ["ascii_art", "colors", "emojis", "personality"],
    "critical_moments": ["first_run", "success", "milestone"],
    "fallback": "rich_text_with_emoji"
  }
}
```

Tools declare their experience intent. Platforms respect it. Developers keep their joy.

---

## What We're Building

**FAF v2.0.0** ships with:
- Automatic platform detection
- Experience preservation for limited platforms
- Fallback modes that maintain personality
- Open-source reference implementation

But we can't do this alone.

---

## The Call to Action

### To CLI Tool Creators:
Your celebrations, colors, and personality aren't frivolous. They're essential. Design for joy, and demand platforms preserve it.

### To AI Platform Teams:
- **OpenAI**: Your developers deserve to see their tools' personality
- **Google**: Gemini tries‚Äîhelp it succeed fully
- **Anthropic**: Claude shows it's possible‚Äîthank you

### To the Community:
Share your terminal joy. Post your favorite CLI moments. Use #TerminalJoy and #SaveCLIExperience.

---

## The Test You Can Run Today

Try it yourself. Run any expressive CLI through different AI assistants. See what survives. See what dies.

Then ask: Is this the future we want?

---

## Who We Are

We're the team behind FAF‚Äîmore than just a CLI:

**The Format**: `.faf` files that solve the AI context problem. One file, perfect understanding.

**The Tool**: FAF CLI v2.0.0 with TURBO-CAT‚Ñ¢, where every command is a championship moment.

**The Integration**: Anthropic-approved MCP for Claude Desktop. Official. Trusted. Revolutionary.

**The Mission**: Transform developer psychology from hope-driven to trust-driven AI development. 30 seconds replaces 20 minutes of questions.

## The Bottom Line

We're not asking platforms to preserve ASCII art because it's pretty.

We're asking them to preserve it because behind every CLI with personality is a developer who cared enough to make their tool bring joy. Behind every emoji is an intention. Behind every color is a choice.

When we flatten these experiences, we don't just lose pixels.
**We lose the soul of software craftsmanship.**

*To Guillermo, Sindre, Rich, Addy, and every CLI creator who ever added an emoji to make someone smile: We see you. We value you. Let's make sure AI sees you too.*
