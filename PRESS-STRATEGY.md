**Tone**: Formal, technical, research-oriented
**Target**: 
- arXiv.org
- ResearchGate  
- Academic journals
- Wikipedia
- Google Scholar

**Key Messages**:
- Open specification
- Technical architecture
- Research applications
- Objective metrics

### 2. MEDIA/TECH RELEASE  
**File**: `docs/business/PRESS-RELEASE-FAF-FORMAT.md`
**Tone**: Story-driven, revolutionary, exciting
**Target**:
- TechCrunch

## Distribution Strategy

### Week 1: Technical Community
1. **GitHub** (PUBLIC repo): Post academic release

## Critical Points

### What to Emphasize:
- .faf is an **open format** (PUBLIC)
- Works with ALL AI tools
- MIT licensed specification
