# 📧 FAF Email Service Implementation

## The Strategy: Value First, Then Feed the Cat

### Core Concept
**"Send yourself a hard copy - you'll be glad you did"**

We position email as a FREE SERVICE that delivers real value:
- Your .faf file as an attachment (hard copy backup)
- Quick start instructions
- Tips to reach 99% (subtle "feed the cat" messaging)

### When Users See Email Service

1. **After `faf auto` Success** (Primary Discovery)
   ```
   Next steps:
   • Email hard copy: faf email (you'll want this!)
   ```

2. **Direct Command**
   ```bash
   faf email                    # Interactive
   faf email me@example.com     # Quick send
   faf email --send             # Use saved email
   ```

### The User Flow

1. **User runs `faf auto`** → Success! → "Email hard copy: faf email (you'll want this!)"
2. **User runs `faf email`** → "Send yourself a hard copy - you'll be glad you did"
3. **User enters email** → Option to remember for next time
4. **Email sent** → Shows what they'll receive

### What Gets Emailed

**Subject:** Your .faf File - [Project Name]

**Body:**
```
Hi there! 👋

Here's your .faf file for safekeeping.

Attached: project.faf (2.3KB)

Quick Start:
1. Drop this .faf into any project root
2. Run 'faf show' to see your score
3. Run 'faf bi-sync' to keep it synced

```

### The Psychology

1. **Authoritative**: "You'll want this" - we know what's good for them
2. **Value First**: Free service, real utility
3. **Subtle Upsell**: Footer mentions pro features naturally
4. **Viral Element**: "Have you been dot.faffed yet?" tagline

### TURBO-CAT Appearances

- **5% chance** after email sends successfully
- Message: "🏎️😸 TURBO-CAT says: Meow! Consider feeding me at faf.one/pro"
- Keeps it rare and special

### Email Storage

- Saves email to `~/.faf/config.json`
- Remembers for next time (with user permission)
- Makes repeat usage frictionless

### Future Integration Points

1. **Auto-email on significant events**:
   - Score improvements
   - New version releases
   - Achievement unlocks

2. **Email as distribution channel**:
   - New features announcements
   - Success stories from other users
   - Tips and tricks

3. **Team features**:
   - Share .faf with team members
   - Collaborative context management

### Success Metrics

- **Email capture rate**: % who use email service
- **Repeat usage**: % who email multiple times
- **Conversion**: % who upgrade to Pro from email footer
- **Viral spread**: New users from "dot.faffed" shares

### The Beauty

It's not "give us your email" - it's "get your hard copy emailed"
They're not signing up - they're backing up their work
We're not marketing - we're providing a service

**The cat gets fed when users realize they WANT to pay, not when we ASK them to.**
