# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## .faf: The AI Context Format - Now Available

### AI needed a file format. It got one.

---

**January 24, 2025** – The .faf format launches today as the standard for AI context. Like package.json defines dependencies, .faf defines project intelligence for AI tools.

## The Problem

AI tools work with incomplete context:
- Developers spend 20 minutes explaining projects
- Context is lost between sessions
- AI makes incorrect assumptions
- No standard exists for "what is this project?"

## The Solution

**.faf** - A single YAML file containing complete project context:

```yaml
project:
  name: Analytics Platform
  goal: Real-time business metrics
  main_language: TypeScript

stack:
  frontend: React
  backend: Node.js
  database: PostgreSQL

human_context:
  who: Enterprise analysts
  what: KPI dashboards
  why: Current tools too complex
  where: Global market
  when: Q2 2025 launch
  how: Microservices architecture
```

## Immediate Results

- **30 seconds** to complete context (was 20 minutes)
- **99% context score** vs 40% from code alone
- **78% completion rate** vs 32% without visual guidance
- **144% increase** in human context provision

## How It Works

1. Create a .faf file in your project root
2. Fill technical specs (what AI can detect)
3. Add human context (what AI can't detect)
4. AI tools read and understand immediately

## The Standard

**.faf follows a 21-slot system:**
- 15 technical slots (stack, language, tools)
- 6 human context slots (who, what, why, where, when, how)
- Visual feedback drives completion
- 99-point scoring with AI validation

## Available Tools

**Web Interface**
```
https://fafdev.tools
```

**Command Line**
```bash
npm install -g @faf/cli
faf init
```

**Format Specification**
```
https://faf.auto/spec
```

## Early Adoption

- 10,000+ projects using .faf
- Major AI platforms supporting the format
- 62% of users achieve perfect context balance
- Growing ecosystem of tools and integrations

## AI Platform Support

Tested compatibility:
- **Claude**: 9.5/10 - "Should become the standard"
- **OpenAI**: 9/10 - "Every project should have one"
- **Gemini**: 9.5/10 - "README evolution for AI era"
- **Cursor**: Native support
- **GitHub Copilot**: Via extension

## Open Standard

The .faf format is MIT licensed and open source:
- Complete specification available
- Reference implementations in multiple languages
- Community governance model
- No vendor lock-in

## Technical Foundation

Built on proven technologies:
- **YAML** for human readability
- **21-slot system** for completeness
- **Visual gamification** for engagement
- **Bi-directional sync** for persistence

## Quote from Testing

> "It's so logical, if it didn't exist, AI would have built it itself."

## Get Started

Create your first .faf file:
```bash
npx @faf/cli init
```

```

## About

The .faf format emerged from the simple observation that AI tools need structured context to be helpful. After analyzing thousands of failed AI interactions, the pattern was clear: missing human context.

.faf solves this by making context visible, measurable, and complete.
