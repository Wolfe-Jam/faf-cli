# üèéÔ∏è Dev Approach Recommendation - Who Should Build This?

## The Championship Question: Claude.ai vs Your Regular Devs

---

## üéØ The Specific Task

**What Needs Building:**
- Port FAB-FORMATS engine from Svelte to CLI (TypeScript)
- Replace TURBO-CAT completely
- Integrate 5+ innovation tools
- Fix scoring from 24% ‚Üí 85%+

**Complexity Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Not inventing (code exists)
- But needs precision porting
- Must maintain performance
- Critical for Monday ship

---

## üí≠ Claude.ai Advantages

### PROS:
‚úÖ **Already Has Full Context** - Knows entire FAF story
‚úÖ **Understands the Why** - Gets the F1 philosophy
‚úÖ **Seen Both Codebases** - Analyzed web and CLI
‚úÖ **No Ramp Time** - Can start immediately
‚úÖ **Proven Track Record** - Built the spec, found the issues

### CONS:
‚ùå **Can't Test Locally** - You'll need to run tests
‚ùå **Sequential Work** - Can't parallelize like team
‚ùå **Context Limits** - Might need multiple sessions

### BEST FOR:
- Initial port of FAB-FORMATS
- Architecture decisions
- Code review/optimization

---

## üë• Your Regular Devs Advantages

### PROS:
‚úÖ **Can Test Immediately** - Local environment
‚úÖ **Team Parallelization** - Multiple files at once
‚úÖ **Deep Debugging** - Can trace issues
‚úÖ **Continuous Integration** - Deploy pipeline

### CONS:
‚ùå **Need Context** - Don't know FAF philosophy
‚ùå **Ramp Up Time** - Must understand why not just what
‚ùå **Might "Improve"** - Risk of over-engineering
‚ùå **May Not Get Urgency** - "Ship Monday" mentality

### BEST FOR:
- Testing and debugging
- Performance optimization
- CI/CD setup

---

## üèÜ My Recommendation: HYBRID APPROACH

### Phase 1: Claude.ai STARTS (Tonight)
```
1. Port FileProcessor.ts ‚Üí fab-formats-engine.ts
2. Update score-calculator.ts
3. Create initial test suite
4. Document integration points
```
**Why:** Claude knows EXACTLY what needs porting and why

### Phase 2: Your Devs POLISH (Tomorrow)
```
1. Run comprehensive tests
2. Fix any edge cases
3. Optimize performance
4. Set up deployment
```
**Why:** They can debug and test locally

### Phase 3: Claude.ai REVIEWS (Sunday)
```
1. Review implementation
2. Verify nothing missed
3. Check philosophy alignment
4. Final scoring validation
```
**Why:** Claude can verify championship quality

## üìù If You Choose Claude.ai

### Give This Prompt:
```
"Port the FAB-FORMATS engine from /Users/wolfejam/FAF/faf-svelte-engine/src/lib/services/FileProcessor.ts to the CLI at /Users/wolfejam/FAF/cli/.

Replace TURBO-CAT completely in score-calculator.ts. Must achieve 85%+ scoring (currently 24%).

This ships Monday. No invention - use existing web code. Test with: npm test and npm run score

Source locations in: /Users/wolfejam/FAF/cli/SOURCE-CODE-LOCATIONS.md"
```

---

## üìù If You Choose Your Devs

### Give Them This Context:
```
URGENT: Ship Monday

We're replacing our broken TURBO-CAT engine with the proven FAB-FORMATS engine from our web app.

Current scoring: 24% (broken)
Target scoring: 85%+ (championship)

DO NOT IMPROVE OR REINVENT - JUST PORT

Source: /faf-svelte-engine/src/lib/services/FileProcessor.ts
Target: /cli/src/engines/fab-formats-engine.ts

Full spec: /cli/CLI-BUILD-SPEC.md
Code locations: /cli/SOURCE-CODE-LOCATIONS.md

This is F1 - we rebuild engines overnight. Speed matters.
```

---

## ‚ö° The F1 Decision

### Like Choosing Pit Strategy:

**Claude.ai = Soft Tyres**
- Faster initial pace
- Perfect understanding
- Might need stops (context)

**Your Devs = Hard Tyres**
- Steadier pace
- Can go full distance
- Need warmup (context)

**Hybrid = Multi-Stop Strategy**
- Best of both
- Risk mitigation
- Championship approach

---

## üèÅ My Vote?

**Start with Claude.ai tonight for the core port.**

Why:
1. Claude knows the full story
2. No context explanation needed
3. Can work while you sleep
4. Has seen both codebases
5. Understands "no invention, just port"

Then have your devs test and polish tomorrow.

**This is a 72-hour rebuild. Use all available resources.**

---

## The Bottom Line

You've got:
- Complete specification (CLI-BUILD-SPEC.md)
- Exact source locations (SOURCE-CODE-LOCATIONS.md)
- Clear success criteria (85%+ scoring)
- Monday deadline

**Whether Claude.ai or your devs - the blueprint is ready.**

The question isn't who CAN do it.
The question is who can do it BY MONDAY with CHAMPIONSHIP QUALITY.

üèÜ **My bet? Claude.ai for the port, your devs for the polish.**

*Ship it Monday. Make it championship.*
