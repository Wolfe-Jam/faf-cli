# üìß Thank You Email to Boris (Claude Code Creator)

## Subject: Thank you for Claude Code - It helped me build something special

---

Hi Boris,

I wanted to reach out and thank you for creating Claude Code. It's been instrumental in helping me build the .faf ecosystem, which just crossed 1,000 weekly downloads.

**The impact Claude Code had:**
- Helped me refactor and optimize my TypeScript codebase
- Caught edge cases I would have missed
- Made complex multi-file operations manageable
- The todo system kept me organized during 12-hour coding sessions

**What I built with Claude Code's help:**
- `.faf` - A universal AI context format (like JPEG for AI)
- MCP server for Claude Desktop (800+ weekly downloads)
- CLI tool for any terminal (201+ weekly downloads)
- Zero-dependency scoring engine

The most magical moment was when Claude Code helped me extract a zero-dependency core package from a complex codebase in one session. What would have taken me days of careful refactoring was done in hours.

**My favorite Claude Code features:**
1. Multi-file editing that actually works
2. The todo tracking (brilliant for ADHD developers like me)
3. Understanding project context across sessions
4. The speed - no more waiting for responses

I especially appreciate how Claude Code handles large codebases. My project has 100+ files, and it navigates them flawlessly.

**A small token of appreciation:**
If you haven't been "dot.faffed" yet, I'd love to give you early access to our Pro features. The tools you've built deserve tools that understand them!

```bash
npm install -g faf-cli claude-faf-mcp
faf auto  # 3 minutes to 99% AI context
```

Thank you for building something that doesn't just assist with code - it transforms how we build. Claude Code didn't just help me write better code; it helped me think better about code architecture.

Have you been dot.faffed yet? üß°‚ö°Ô∏è
(Sorry, couldn't resist our tagline!)

With gratitude and respect,
[Your name]

P.S. - If you ever need AI context management for your projects, .faf is here for you. It's the least I can do for all the hours Claude Code has saved me.

Hi Boris,

Quick thank you - Claude Code was instrumental in building .faf (1,000+ weekly downloads now!).

Your multi-file editing and todo system are game-changers. They helped me refactor a complex TypeScript codebase into a zero-dependency core in hours, not days.

If you ever need instant AI context for your projects: `npm install -g faf-cli`
