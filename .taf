root_causes:

    symptom: "ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd"
    root_cause: Jest cache corruption from previous test runs that modified
      process.cwd() and deleted directories while process was inside them
    affected_runs: 1
    severity: critical
    fix: "Added maxWorkers: 1 to prevent parallel cwd corruption + npm run
      clean:cache"
    prevention: "Meta-test now validates Jest config has maxWorkers: 1"
    resolution_time_minutes: 13
  - issue_id: RCA-002
    symptom: Parallel test race conditions causing cascade failures
    root_cause: Multiple test workers simultaneously modifying global process.cwd() state
    affected_runs: 1
    severity: high
    fix: "Set maxWorkers: 1 in jest.config.js for sequential execution"
    prevention: Meta-test validates sequential execution enforcement
    resolution_time_minutes: 13
  - issue_id: RCA-003
    symptom: MODULE_NOT_FOUND for ${CLI_PATH}
    root_cause: Template literal syntax bug - used single quotes instead of
      backticks (11 instances)
    affected_tests: drift.test.ts
    instances: 11
    severity: medium
    fix: Replaced all execSync('node ${VAR}') with execSync(`node ${VAR}`)
    prevention: Meta-test now automatically scans all test files for this pattern
    resolution_time_minutes: 7
    note: Latent bugs - did not affect current pass rate but would have caused
      failures when those test branches executed

  championship_achievement: Testing the tests - exposed WJTTC blind spot and closed it
taf_metadata:
  specification_version: 1.0.0
  created_by: claude-faf-mcp
  purpose: Lightweight testing changelog - fills gap between testing events and
    git commits
  storage_strategy: Lives alongside .faf in project root, commits with code changes
  rotation_policy: Keep last 1000 runs, archive older runs to WJTTC
  integration: Phase 1 (Manual) - proving the concept
