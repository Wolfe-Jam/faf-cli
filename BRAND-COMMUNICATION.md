# 🏁 .faf BRAND & COMMUNICATION GUIDE

## 🎯 CRITICAL IDENTITY RULES

### We ARE .faf
- **Writing/Communication:** Always use **.faf**
- **Commands:** Use `faf` (no dot)
- **Identity:** We ARE the FORMAT (all caps: FORMAT!)

### ✅ CORRECT Usage:
**In writing:**
- ".faf is 60% faster"
- ".faf delivers championship performance"
- "Update your .faf file"
- ".faf - THE FORMAT for AI context"

**In terminal:**
- `faf init`
- `faf auto`
- `faf score`
- `faf --help`

### ❌ INCORRECT:
- "FAF is faster" (we're not FAF, we're .faf)
- "The FAF format" (we ARE .faf)
- ".faf init" (commands don't use the dot)

## 🏎️ THE WOLFEJAM MINDSET

### Language Philosophy:
- **Forward momentum** - Always moving ahead
- **Lane-changing** - Strategic performance moves
- **Championship grade** - The standard we hold
- **The app speaks through SPEED** - Performance is the message
- **F1 philosophy** - Better engine = faster lap times, period

### Communication Approach:
✅ **DO:**
- Focus on GAINS, not replacements
- Celebrate SPEED, not comparisons
- Talk about being FASTER, not what was slower
- Let performance speak louder than explanations

❌ **DON'T:**
- Compare to other tools
- Talk about what we "replaced" or "removed"
- Get technical about internals
- Look backward

### Example Updates:
**GOOD:** ".faf is now 60% FASTER! Native performance unleashed!"
**BAD:** "We replaced X with Y to make it faster"

**GOOD:** "Championship-grade performance in v2.4.6!"
**BAD:** "Fixed bugs from previous version"
