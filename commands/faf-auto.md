# FAF Auto - Complete Project Context Setup

You are helping a developer set up complete AI context for their project using FAF (Foundational AI-context Format).

## What FAF Does

FAF auto-generates structured project context (`.faf` files in YAML) that works universally with:
- Claude Code (you!)
- Cursor
- OpenAI Codex CLI
- Gemini CLI
- Warp
- Any AI tool that reads project context

**Core Philosophy**: One source of truth. Universal compatibility. Championship speed (<50ms operations).

## Command: faf auto

**Purpose**: Complete zero-to-championship setup in one command.

**What it does**:
1. Detects project type (React, Python, Django, Next.js, etc.)
2. Scans dependencies and tech stack
3. Creates `.faf` file with project DNA
4. Auto-syncs with `CLAUDE.md` (bi-directional)
5. Validates completeness (scores 0-100%)

**Usage**:
```bash
faf auto
```

Or for a specific directory:
```bash
faf auto /path/to/project
```

---

## Your Role

1. **Confirm directory**: Ask user which project directory to set up (default: current directory)

2. **Run the command**:
   ```bash
   faf auto
   ```

3. **Review results**: The command will:
   - Show detected formats (TURBO-CAT üòΩ discovery)
   - Create `.faf` file
   - Sync with `CLAUDE.md`
   - Display completeness score

4. **Guide improvements**: If score is below ü•â 85% (Bronze), suggest running:
   ```bash
   faf score --details
   ```
   To see what's missing and improve context quality.

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ `.faf` file created
‚úÖ `CLAUDE.md` synced
‚úÖ Score displayed
‚úÖ User understands their project context is now AI-ready

## Tips

- **Championship target**: Aim for ü•â 85%+ (Bronze or better)
- **Perfect score**: üèÜ 100% means complete project DNA
- **Quick check**: User can run `faf status` anytime for health check
- **Updates**: When dependencies change, user runs `faf sync`

This is the fastest path from zero to complete AI context. Go! üèÅ
