# üèÅ NPM PUBLISH CHECKLIST - Championship Edition

## The Goal: `npm publish` should be ONE COMMAND
**You should feel: Slightly nervous, but READY TO RACE because the car is PERFECT!**

---

## üìã PRE-PUBLISH VERIFICATION (Do this BEFORE even thinking about publish)

### 1. BUILD - Zero Tolerance Policy
```bash
npm run build
```
‚úÖ **MUST HAVE:** ZERO TypeScript errors
‚úÖ **MUST HAVE:** ZERO build warnings
‚ùå **NO EXCUSES:** Fix ALL errors first

### 2. DEPENDENCIES - Lean & Mean
```bash
grep -A5 '"dependencies"' package.json
```
‚úÖ Every dependency JUSTIFIED
‚úÖ No bloat, no redundancy
‚úÖ Consider: Can we build it native instead?

### 3. TESTS - Know Your Numbers
```bash
npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "Test Suites:|Tests:" | tail -2
```
‚úÖ **MINIMUM:** 90% tests passing
‚úÖ **CRITICAL:** All core functionality tests MUST pass
‚úÖ **PERFORMANCE:** All benchmarks under target

### 4. CLI SMOKE TEST - It Actually Works!
```bash
./dist/cli.js --version  # Shows correct version?
./dist/cli.js --help     # Help looks good?
./dist/cli.js init       # Core commands work?
```
‚úÖ Version displays correctly
‚úÖ Help text is accurate
‚úÖ Basic commands execute

### 5. CODE QUALITY - VIP Inspection Ready
```bash
# Check for debugging artifacts
grep -r "console.log\|TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" src/ --exclude-dir=tests

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short
```
‚úÖ NO debugging console.logs
‚úÖ NO unfinished TODOs
‚úÖ Clean git status

### 6. VERSION & CHANGELOG
```bash
# CHECK VERSION TRUTH - No more surprises!
npm run version:truth

# This tells you:
# - What's local vs what's on npm
# - If there's a conflict
# - What version to use next

# README has update notes
head -15 README.md
```
‚úÖ Version number correct
‚úÖ README has "What's New" section
‚úÖ Update is user-friendly (not technical jargon)

### 7. FINAL BUILD & TEST
```bash
npm run build && npm test
```
‚úÖ Everything STILL works after all changes

---

## üöÄ THE MOMENT OF TRUTH

If ALL above checks are ‚úÖ, then publishing is just:

```bash
npm publish
```

**That's it!** One command because you did the work RIGHT.

---

## üèÜ CHAMPIONSHIP STANDARDS

### What "READY" feels like:
- **Slightly nervous** - It's a release, stakes are high!
- **Confident** - You've checked everything
- **Excited** - Users are getting something BETTER
- **Clean** - No "we'll fix it later" items

### What "NOT READY" looks like:
- TypeScript errors you're "ignoring"
- Tests failing you "don't care about"
- TODOs scattered in the code
- "It works on my machine"
- Haven't actually run the CLI

### The F1 Philosophy:
**You don't enter the race with a broken car.**
**You don't publish with a broken build.**

---

## üîß MAINTENANCE NOTES

- Run this checklist FULLY, even for "small" releases
- If something fails, FIX IT before publishing
- No "publish now, fix later" - that's how we get pink text bugs!
- Keep dependencies minimal - less to break
- Test like you're about to drive 200mph - because users will!

*"Publishing should be boring because preparation was thorough."* üèéÔ∏è

**Remember:** The goal is to make `npm publish` feel like pressing a button, not pulling a trigger!
