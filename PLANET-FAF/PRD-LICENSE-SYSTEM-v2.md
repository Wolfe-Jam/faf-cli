# Product Requirements Document: FAF License System v2
## Incorporating Championship Feedback

## Key Changes from v1

### 1. Free Tier Adjustment ✅
**OLD**: 70% cap (too frustrating)
**NEW**: 85% cap (perfect hook point)
- Gets users invested
- Shows real value
- Natural upgrade point at 85% → "You're so close to 100%!"

### 2. Championship Mode (Friday Feature) 🏁
**NEW FEATURE**: Temporary power boost
```bash
$ faf championship
🏁 CHAMPIONSHIP MODE ACTIVATED!
⚡ 100% scoring for 1 hour
🎯 Show your team what's possible!
⏰ Expires at: 14:30:00
```

Use cases:
- Client demos
- Team presentations
- "Try before you buy"
- Friday afternoon fun

### 3. Enhanced License Format
**OLD**: `TYPE-ENGINE-EXPIRY-SIGNATURE`

## Security Reality Check

### What We Accept:
1. **Obfuscation WILL be cracked**
   - That's fine - pirates weren't customers anyway
   - Enterprises need legitimate licenses for compliance
   - Support/updates are the real value

2. **Keys WILL be shared**
   - Add usage analytics (non-blocking)
   - Flag suspicious patterns
   - But don't break legitimate use

3. **Some will stay on free forever**
   - That's OK! They're evangelists
   - 85% is genuinely useful
   - They recommend to enterprises

### Mitigation Strategy:
```javascript
// Soft enforcement, not hard blocking
if (detectSuspiciousUsage()) {
  console.log('💡 This license seems popular! Consider our team plan.');
  // Still works, just logged
}
```

## The Adobe Model

You nailed it - this IS the Adobe Creative Cloud approach:

1. **Everything ships in one package**
   - Photoshop has all features in the binary
   - License unlocks capabilities
   - No separate downloads

2. **Offline-first validation**
   - Check license locally
   - Periodic online refresh (optional)
   - Never break workflow

3. **Clear tier progression**
   - Photography plan → Individual → Business
   - Each tier unlocks more apps/features
   - Same installer for all

## Championship Mode Implementation

```typescript
class ChampionshipMode {
  private static activeUntil: Date | null = null;

  static activate(): void {
    this.activeUntil = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000); // 1 hour

    console.log('🏁 CHAMPIONSHIP MODE ACTIVATED!');
    console.log('⚡ Unleashing 100% power for 1 hour');
    console.log('🎯 Perfect for demos and presentations');

    // Track activation (for insights, not enforcement)
    this.trackActivation();
  }

  static isActive(): boolean {
    if (!this.activeUntil) return false;
    if (new Date() > this.activeUntil) {
      this.activeUntil = null;
      console.log('⏰ Championship mode expired');
      console.log('💡 Upgrade to keep this power!');
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }

  static getTimeRemaining(): string {
    if (!this.activeUntil) return 'Not active';
    const ms = this.activeUntil.getTime() - Date.now();
    const minutes = Math.floor(ms / 60000);
    return `${minutes} minutes`;
  }

  private static trackActivation(): void {
    // Non-blocking analytics
    process.nextTick(() => {
      // Log usage pattern for insights
      // Maybe they're demoing to their boss?
    });
  }
}
```

## Updated Success Metrics

### Conversion Funnel:
1. **Install → First Use**: 100%
2. **First Use → Hit 85% Cap**: 60% (most will hit it)
3. **Hit Cap → Try Championship Mode**: 40%
4. **Championship → Trial**: 20%
5. **Trial → Paid**: 30%
6. **Paid → Higher Tier**: 25%

### Key Insights:
- Free at 85% keeps people happy AND wanting more
- Championship Mode creates "aha!" moments
- Feature flags allow instant upgrades
- Soft enforcement maintains goodwill

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:
- Hard-block on suspected piracy
- Require constant internet
- Make free tier useless
- Shame users for using free
- Break existing workflows

### ✅ Do:
- Gentle upgrade nudges
- Show what they're missing
- Reward legitimate users
- Make upgrading seamless
- Keep free tier valuable

## The Psychology Game

### Free (85%):
"You're doing great! Your code scores 85%!"
"💡 Pro tip: Unlock 100% with faf license upgrade"

### Championship Mode:
"🏁 WOW! Your code hit 100%!"
"⏰ 45 minutes of Championship Mode remaining"
"💰 Keep this power: faf license upgrade"

### Professional:
"✨ Championship performance achieved!"
"🏆 You're operating at peak efficiency"

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Now):
1. Adjust free tier to 85%
2. Implement Championship Mode
3. Add feature flags to license format

### Phase 2 (Next):
1. Soft usage analytics
2. Upgrade flow optimization
3. A/B test messaging

### Phase 3 (Later):
1. Team licenses
2. Usage dashboard
3. Auto-renewal

## Final Notes

Your insight about 85% being the right free tier cap is spot-on. It's the "goldilocks zone":
- High enough to be genuinely useful
- Low enough to create upgrade desire
- Fair enough to build goodwill

The Championship Mode is a brilliant Friday Feature that solves the demo problem while creating upgrade moments.

This is how you build a sustainable business model on top of open source - not by restricting, but by progressively enhancing!
