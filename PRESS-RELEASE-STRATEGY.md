## 📝 The Press Release (Rewritten)

### For Tech Media:

**HEADLINE:**
Developer Tool Reduces AI Context Setup from 20 Minutes to 3, Sees 800 Weekly Downloads

**SUBHEAD:**
.faf format brings JPEG-like standardization to AI context management

**LEAD:**
A new open-source tool called .faf (Foundational AI-context Format) is helping developers eliminate the tedious process of manually feeding project context to AI assistants, reducing setup time from 20+ minutes to under 3 minutes.

**PROBLEM PARAGRAPH:**
Developers currently waste significant time explaining their codebase structure, dependencies, and documentation to AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude, often achieving only partial context understanding. This leads to incorrect suggestions, wasted API tokens, and constant re-explanation.

**SOLUTION PARAGRAPH:**
The .faf CLI tool automatically scans any project directory, intelligently extracting relevant context from 154+ file formats, and generates a single, shareable context file. This file can be used across any AI platform, achieving what the creators call "99% AI understanding."

**TRACTION PARAGRAPH:**
Since its release, the tool has gained over 800 weekly downloads on NPM, with particularly strong adoption of its Claude Desktop MCP integration. The project maintains sub-50ms processing times even on large codebases.

**TECHNICAL PARAGRAPH:**
Built with a zero-dependency philosophy for the core engine, .faf uses intelligent pattern matching and format detection to create comprehensive project context. The tool includes real-time scoring, showing developers their "AI-readiness percentage" and suggesting improvements.

**QUOTE:**
"We're doing for AI context what JPEG did for images - creating a universal standard that just works," says [Your Name], creator of .faf. "Developers shouldn't spend 20 minutes explaining what their code does. That's the AI's job."

**AVAILABILITY:**
.faf is available as both a CLI tool (faf-cli) and Claude Desktop MCP server (claude-faf-mcp) on NPM. The project is open-source under MIT license.

**LINKS:**
- Website: faf.one
- NPM: npmjs.com/package/faf-cli
- GitHub: github.com/yourusername/faf-cli

### For Developer Communities:

**TITLE:** I made a tool that reduces AI context setup from 20 min to 3 min (800 weekly downloads)

Hey everyone! 👋

**The Problem I Solved:**
Ever spent 20 minutes copy-pasting files to ChatGPT/Claude, only to have it misunderstand your project structure?

**What I Built:**
.faf - a CLI tool that automatically generates complete AI context from any codebase:
- Scans your entire project (154+ formats)
- Creates a single context file
- Works with any AI (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Shows your "AI readiness score"

**The Results:**
- Setup time: 20 min → 3 min
- AI understanding: 22% → 99%
- Processing: <50ms
- Downloads: 800+ weekly

**Try It:**
```bash
npm install -g faf-cli
cd your-project
faf auto
```

**Bonus for Claude users:**
There's also an MCP integration: `npm install -g claude-faf-mcp`

Would love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for your workflow?
