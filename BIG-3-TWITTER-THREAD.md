### Tweet 1/12 🚨
We tested one CLI across the BIG-3 AI platforms (Claude, Gemini, Codex).

What we discovered will change how you think about developer tools forever.

A thread on the Terminal Experience Crisis 🧵👇

### Tweet 2/12 📊
The test: Run a CLI with personality (ASCII art, emojis, colors) through each platform.

Results:
🥇 Claude: 10/10 - Full experience
🥈 Gemini: 7/10 - Tries hard, corrupts ASCII
🥉 Codex: 3/10 - Complete sanitization

### Tweet 3/12 🎨
Here's what Claude shows (perfect):

Here's what Codex shows:
"faf init executed successfully"

We're losing the soul of our tools.

### Tweet 4/12 😱
This is what happens to @pnpmjs's emojis on Codex: ❌ GONE
This is what happens to @rustlang's friendly errors: ❌ STRIPPED
This is what happens to @yarnpkg's personality: ❌ SANITIZED

2 out of 3 AI platforms are killing CLI joy.

### Tweet 5/12 🏆
Remember your first successful build? That celebration moment?

What you should see:
"🎉 Build successful! You're a rockstar! 🚀"

What Codex shows:
"Build completed."

Which creates developers who love their craft?

### Tweet 6/12 😽
Meet TURBO-CAT™ - our format detection engine with personality.

On Claude: "I detected 154 formats and made your stack PURRR! 😽"
On Codex: [Nothing. Sanitized. Gone.]

This isn't progress. It's regression.

### Tweet 7/12 💡
We're proposing the Terminal Experience Protocol (TEP).

A simple contract:
- CLIs declare their experience intent
- AI platforms preserve it
- Developers keep their joy

Who's with us? 🙋

---

### Tweet 8/12 📢
To @OpenAI: Your Codex strips ALL personality
To @Google: Gemini tries but needs help with ASCII
To @AnthropicAI: Claude gets it perfect - THANK YOU

This isn't about pretty colors. It's about developer happiness.

---

### Tweet 9/12 🛠️
We're shipping FAF v2.0.0:
✅ .faf format (AI context files)
✅ Anthropic-approved MCP for Claude Desktop
✅ Platform detection & preservation
✅ Open source everything

But we need the community's help.

---

### Tweet 10/12 🎯
The numbers:
- ASCII Art: 1/3 platforms preserve it
- Colors: 1/3 platforms show them
- Emojis: 2/3 platforms display them
- Personality: 1/3 platforms maintain it

We're literally losing 67% of CLI experience.

---

### Tweet 11/12 🚀
Try it yourself:
1. Pick your favorite expressive CLI
2. Run it through Claude, Gemini, and Codex
3. See what survives
4. Share with #TerminalJoy #SaveCLIExperience

Let's document this crisis.

---

### Tweet 12/12 ❤️
To every developer who added an emoji to brighten someone's day...
To every creator who drew ASCII art for a banner...
To every builder who wrote a friendly error message...

We see you. We value you.
Let's make sure AI sees you too.

**Title:** The Hidden Crisis in Developer Tools: How AI is Flattening CLI Experiences

As AI becomes the primary interface for development, we're witnessing an alarming trend: the systematic removal of personality from our tools.

Our recent study tested CLI output across Claude, Gemini, and Codex. The results:
- 67% of platforms strip visual elements
- 100% lose color on at least one platform
- Critical celebration moments are reduced to plain text

This isn't about aesthetics. It's about developer engagement, satisfaction, and the craft of software development.

We're proposing the Terminal Experience Protocol (TEP) - a standard ensuring AI platforms preserve the carefully crafted experiences tool creators design.

## Reddit r/programming Post

**Title:** We tested one CLI across Claude, Gemini, and Codex. The results show a massive experience fragmentation problem.

Hey r/programming,

We built a CLI with personality (ASCII art, colors, emojis - think Homebrew's 🍺 or Yarn's playful style) and ran it through the big 3 AI platforms.

Results:
- **Claude**: Perfect 10/10 - shows everything
- **Gemini**: 7/10 - tries hard, corrupts ASCII
- **Codex**: 3/10 - strips everything to "executed successfully"

This is a bigger problem than it seems. As more devs interact with tools through AI, we're losing the joy, personality, and celebration moments that make development fun.

We're proposing a standard (Terminal Experience Protocol) to preserve CLI experiences across AI platforms.

Thoughts? Anyone else noticed this flattening of developer experience?
