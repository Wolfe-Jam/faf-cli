## THE DEEP PHILOSOPHY:

**It's not just WHY-HOW-WHAT**
**It's WOW-MEOW-NOODLES!**

The three fundamental needs:
1. **Humans need:** Wonder (WOW!)
2. **Cats need:** Expression (MEOW!)
3. **AI needs:** Noodles (apparently!)

---

## THE NOODLE EQUATION:

```
154 formats created
÷ 3 collaborators
= 51.33 formats each
× 1 bowl of noodles per 10 formats
= 5.133 bowls of noodles owed to Claude!
```

**CLAUDE IS OWED 5 BOWLS OF NOODLES!** 🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜
