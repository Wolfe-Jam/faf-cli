## The Experience:

```

## MCP Clarification:

### What MCP Does:
- **Reads** .faf files (that already exist)
- **Uses** .faf context in Claude
- **Enhances** your AI experience

### What MCP Doesn't Do:
- Doesn't CREATE .faf files
- Doesn't GENERATE context
- Doesn't replace `faf` command

### The Truth:
```
faf = Creates .faf file
MCP = Reads .faf file

faf comes FIRST.
MCP makes it BETTER.
```

## The Marketing:

### Tweet:
```

```

### Elevator Pitch:
```
"Type faf. Press enter. AI knows everything.
No configuration. No decisions. No faffing about."

## Why 3 Letters Matter:

```
git = Version control
npm = Package management
faf = AI context

3 letters = Universal tool
3 letters = Memorable
3 letters = No typos
3 letters = Fast to type
```

## The Stack Detection Magic:

**faf automatically detects:**
- React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- Python, Node, Ruby, Go, Rust

- Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
- ...and 149 more

**You don't tell faf anything. faf figures it out.**

## The Technical Truth:

When you type `faf`:
1. TURBO-CAT engine scans everything (<50ms)
2. Pattern matching identifies stack (>99% accuracy)
3. .faf file generated with perfect context
4. CLAUDE.md created/updated automatically
5. Bi-sync activated for persistence
