# ✅ FAF CLI Double-Rendering Bug Fix

## Bug Report
The FAF CLI v2.4.4 was displaying its ASCII art card TWICE - once at the beginning and once at the end of command output, causing display issues in terminals.

## Root Cause
Commands `version`, `formats`, and `init` were showing the header themselves WHILE the main `cli.ts` was also showing it for these commands, causing duplication.

## Files Fixed
1. `/src/commands/version.ts` - Removed `console.log(generateFAFHeader());` at line 10
2. `/src/commands/formats.ts` - Removed `console.log(generateFAFHeader());` at line 18
3. `/src/commands/init.ts` - Removed header display code at lines 47-50

## Fix Applied
Removed duplicate header calls from individual command files, letting the main `cli.ts` handle header display centrally (as it already does for these commands on line 133-135).

## Result
✅ ASCII art card now displays ONLY ONCE per command
✅ All commands tested and working correctly
✅ No visual artifacts or display issues

## Test Results
```bash
# Before fix: Card appeared TWICE
# After fix: Card appears ONCE (at bottom)

node dist/cli.js version   # ✅ Single card display
node dist/cli.js formats   # ✅ Single card display
node dist/cli.js init      # ✅ Single card display
```

## Impact
- Better terminal compatibility
- Professional appearance
- No more "top 1 inch" cutoff issues in Apple Terminal
- Cleaner command output
