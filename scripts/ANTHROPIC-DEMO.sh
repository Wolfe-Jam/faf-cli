project:
  name: Analytics Dashboard
  goal: Real-time data visualization platform for enterprise metrics
  main_language: TypeScript

stack:
  frontend: React
  ui_library: Material-UI
  state_management: Redux
  backend: Express
  database: PostgreSQL
  runtime: Node.js

human_context:
  who: Enterprise data analysts at Fortune 500 companies
  what: Analyzing real-time business metrics and KPIs
  why: Current tools are too slow and complex for non-technical users
  where: Global deployment on AWS
  when:
    deadline: Q2 2025 launch
    phase: Adding authentication
  how: Microservices architecture with JWT auth

preferences:
  auth_strategy: JWT with refresh tokens
  security_level: Enterprise-grade
  compliance: SOC2, GDPR required
EOF

# Create CLAUDE.md
cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# 🏎️ CLAUDE.md - Analytics Dashboard

## Current Focus
Adding enterprise-grade authentication with JWT

## Architecture Decisions
- Stateless JWT with refresh token rotation
- Redis for session management
- Rate limiting per user
- 2FA required for enterprise accounts

## Context for Authentication Task
- Must integrate with existing corporate SSO
- Audit logging required for compliance
- Session timeout after 30 minutes
- Support for multiple authentication providers

## File Structure
```
/src
  /auth         <- New authentication module goes here
  /api          <- Existing API endpoints
  /components   <- React components
  /services     <- Business logic
```

## Testing Requirements
- 90% coverage required
- E2E tests for auth flow
- Security penetration testing before deployment
