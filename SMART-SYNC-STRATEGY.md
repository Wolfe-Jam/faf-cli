# 🔄 Smart Sync Strategy - Keeping .faf Fresh

## 🎯 The Problem
Users forget to sync, context gets stale, Claude gives outdated suggestions

## 💡 The Solutions

### 1. **Git Hook Integration** (Automatic)
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-sync .faf before commits
faf sync --quiet
git add .faf CLAUDE.md
```
**Pro:** Syncs with their natural workflow
**Con:** Some users don't like auto-hooks

### 2. **Smart Reminders** (Built into CLI)
```bash
faf auto    # First run
```
Then every time they run ANY faf command:
```
💡 Last sync: 7 days ago. Run 'faf sync' to refresh! (takes 3 seconds)
```

### 3. **Score Degradation** (Gamification)
```javascript
// Score naturally decreases over time
function calculateScore(lastSync) {
  const daysSinceSync = getDaysSince(lastSync);
  let penalty = 0;

  if (daysSinceSync > 7) penalty = 5;   // -5% after a week
  if (daysSinceSync > 14) penalty = 10; // -10% after 2 weeks
  if (daysSinceSync > 30) penalty = 20; // -20% after a month

  return baseScore - penalty;
}
```

Show in `faf show`:
```
🏆 FAF Score: 94% (↓ from 99% - last synced 8 days ago)
💡 Run 'faf sync' to get back to 99%!
```

### 4. **Email Reminders** (Optional Service)
```bash
faf email --reminders weekly
```
Sends friendly email:
```
Subject: Your .faf context is 7 days old 🔄

Hey! Quick reminder to sync your project contexts:
- project-1: Last synced 7 days ago
- project-2: Last synced 12 days ago

Run 'faf sync' in each project (takes 3 seconds!)

P.S. Getting 94%? Feed the cat for auto-sync → faf.one/pro
```

### 5. **VS Code Extension** (Future)
```json
// Shows in status bar
"FAF: 99% ✅"           // Fresh
"FAF: 94% (7d) 🔄"      // Needs sync
"FAF: Click to sync"    // One-click update
```

### 6. **The Pro Feature** (Monetization)
```bash
# Bronze (Free): Manual sync reminders
faf sync                 # Manual only

# Pro ($9/month): Auto-sync options
faf auto-sync daily      # Cron job

Your .faf context is like a map of your project.
Maps need updating when the territory changes!

- Daily reminder: Built into CLI
- Auto-sync: Pro feature (feed the cat!)

Most users sync weekly and that's perfect!
```

## 🎯 The Sweet Spot

**For Most Users:**
- Weekly sync is enough
- 3-second command
- Gentle reminders in CLI
- Score shows freshness

**The Key:** Make it VISIBLE but not ANNOYING!

*Remember: The goal is fresh context, not perfect sync. Even week-old context is 10x better than no context!*
