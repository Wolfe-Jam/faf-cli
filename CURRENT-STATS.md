# üìä Current FAF Stats (January 2025)

## Real Numbers (No BS)

### Downloads
- **CLI (faf-cli)**: 201 weekly downloads
- **MCP (claude-faf-mcp)**: 800+ weekly downloads
- **Total Weekly**: 1,000+ downloads combined!

## Marketing Angles by Package

### For MCP (claude-faf-mcp) - The Star! üåü
```
"800+ weekly downloads and climbing!"
"The most downloaded .faf tool"
"Claude Desktop users love it - 800 weekly installs"
```

### For CLI (faf-cli) - The Underdog Story
```
"Join 200+ developers who've been dot.faffed"
"New CLI gaining momentum - 201 weekly downloads"
"The CLI companion to the 800-download MCP"
```

### For Combined Ecosystem - The Power Move
```
"1,000+ weekly downloads across the FAF ecosystem"
"Two tools, one mission: Stop faffing about"
"MCP (800) + CLI (201) = Complete .faf solution"
```

## Why MCP is Crushing It

1. **Claude Desktop Integration** - Direct value for Claude users
2. **MCP Hype** - Everyone wants MCP tools right now
3. **Zero Friction** - Works immediately in Claude
4. **First Mover** - Early in the MCP ecosystem

## How to Leverage This

### Strategy 1: Lead with MCP
"Our MCP server has 800+ weekly downloads. Also available as CLI!"

### Strategy 2: The Double Down
"Get both: MCP (800 downloads) + CLI (201 downloads) = Full power"

### Strategy 3: Focus on Growth
"From 0 to 1,000+ weekly downloads in [timeframe]"

## Messaging Templates

```

### For Press/Newsletters:
```
The .faf ecosystem sees over 1,000 weekly downloads, with the Claude Desktop
MCP integration leading at 800+ weekly installs, demonstrating strong demand
for AI context management tools.
```

## The Psychological Play

- **800 MCP downloads** = Social proof, validation, "everyone's using it"
- **201 CLI downloads** = "Get in early", room to grow, undervalued
- **1,000+ combined** = Ecosystem momentum, multiple entry points

## What NOT to Say

‚ùå "CLI has 800 downloads" (wrong!)
‚ùå "Both have equal downloads" (not true)
‚ùå Hide the 201 number (be honest)

## What TO Say

‚úÖ "MCP: 800+, CLI: 201+ weekly downloads"
‚úÖ "1,000+ developers using .faf weekly"
‚úÖ "MCP leads with 800, CLI growing at 201"
‚úÖ "Join 1,000+ developers across both tools"

## Growth Narrative

Week 1: Launch
Week 2: 100 downloads
Week 3: 500 downloads
Week 4: 1,000+ downloads üéâ
Next: 2,000? 5,000?

"We 10x'd in a month. What's next?"

## The Honest Pitch

"Look, our MCP is killing it with 800 weekly downloads because Claude users
need it RIGHT NOW. Our CLI is newer (201 weekly) but growing. Together,
they're the complete .faf ecosystem. Get both, or pick what you need."

**Remember**: MCP's 800 is our hero number. CLI's 201 shows we're not a one-trick pony.
Combined 1,000+ shows ecosystem strength! üöÄ
