## 📈 HISTORICAL GROWTH

| Date | Count (Jest) | Delta | What Changed |
|------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| Oct 6, 2025 | **187** | +31 | YAML Rock Solid fix - 31 torture tests added |
| (Baseline) | ~156 | - | Pre-YAML fix baseline (estimated) |

**Note:** Historical BIG-3 test data from WJTTC may add 12,000-14,000 additional validation tests from quarterly testing cycles. Investigating archives for full count.

## 🎯 TARGETS

**Next Milestone:** 206 tests (+10%)
**Long-term Goal:** 300 tests (comprehensive coverage)
**Stretch Goal:** 12,000+ tests (if including BIG-3 WJTTC validation suite)

**Coverage Priorities:**
1. ✅ YAML parsing (31 tests - COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Command validation (target: +20 tests)
3. ⏳ File operations (target: +15 tests)
4. ⏳ Error handling (target: +10 tests)

## 🏆 STANDARDS

**What Counts as a Test:**
- ✅ Automated test cases (test(), it(), describe())
- ✅ Torture tests (evil edge cases)
- ✅ Integration tests
- ❌ Manual testing
- ❌ Examples
- ❌ Demos

**Quality Bar:**
- Every test must be repeatable
- Every test must validate specific behavior
- Every test must have clear pass/fail
- Edge cases > happy path
