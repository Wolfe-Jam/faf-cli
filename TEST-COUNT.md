## 📈 HISTORICAL GROWTH

| Date | Count (Jest) | Delta | What Changed |

## 🎯 TARGETS

**Next Milestone:** 210 tests (+10%)
**Long-term Goal:** 300 tests (comprehensive coverage)
**Stretch Goal:** 12,000-14,000 tests (including BIG-3 WJTTC validation suite from quarterly archives)

**Coverage Priorities:**
1. ✅ YAML parsing (31 tests - COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Command validation (target: +20 tests)
3. ⏳ File operations (target: +15 tests)
4. ⏳ Error handling (target: +10 tests)

## 🏆 STANDARDS

**What Counts as a Test:**
- ✅ Automated test cases (test(), it(), describe())
- ✅ Torture tests (evil edge cases)
- ✅ Integration tests
- ❌ Manual testing
- ❌ Examples
- ❌ Demos

**Quality Bar:**
- Every test must be repeatable
- Every test must validate specific behavior
- Every test must have clear pass/fail
- Edge cases > happy path
