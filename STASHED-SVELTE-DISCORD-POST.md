## When Ready, The Post:

```markdown
# 🏎️ fafdev.tools - F1-Inspired AI Context Generator (Built with SvelteKit)

Hey Svelte fam! Built something different...

**The Problem:** Explaining your project to AI takes 20 minutes of copy-pasting
**The Solution:** One .faf file that AI instantly understands

Live: https://fafdev.tools

## What makes it special:
- ⚡ Generates AI context in <3 seconds
- 🏁 F1-inspired design (because why not?)
- 🎨 Full visual builder for .faf files
- 📊 Real-time scoring system
- 🏆 Championship mindset for developer tools

## The Svelte Stack:
- SvelteKit (obviously)
- Tailwind for that F1 aesthetic
- Perfect Lighthouse scores
- Zero JS when not needed
- Builds in 1.2 seconds

Not your typical dev tool. Give it a spin and let me know what you think!

## Notes:
- Remove TURBO-CAT references (CLI only)
- Focus on speed + F1 theme
- Keep it casual
- Post when feeling it
