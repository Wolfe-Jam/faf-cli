## What is `project.faf`?

**It's just another file in your project.** Like `package.json` for npm, `project.faf` is for AI.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wolfe-Jam/faf-cli/main/assets/project-faf-screenshot.png" alt="project.faf in file listing" width="600" />
</p>

Once you get used to it, it's just another file helping you code.

---

## The Problem: AI Guesses. You Pay.

Without `project.faf`, every session:
- AI re-discovers your project (costs tokens)
- AI asks questions you've answered before (costs time)
- AI makes wrong assumptions (costs rework)
- Context drifts session to session (costs trust)

**`project.faf` fixes this permanently.**

---

## The Solution: Add `project.faf`

```
🏆 Congrats, your project is optimized for AI.

Over to you. Build something that resonates.
```

At 100% AI Readiness:
- AI knows your stack, goals, and conventions
- Zero clarifying questions needed
- Context persists across sessions
- Drift is impossible — the foundation doesn't move

## 🚀 1-Click Context: The Game Changer

**Generate 90%+ AI context for ANY GitHub repo WITHOUT cloning:**

```bash
npx faf-cli git https://github.com/facebook/react
```

**What just happened?**
- ✅ No install required (`npx` runs latest version)
- ✅ No cloning required (uses GitHub API)
- ✅ 2 seconds → 95% AI-ready context
- ✅ Works on ANY public GitHub repo

**Traditional approach:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/react  # 10-30 seconds
cd react
npm install -g faf-cli                       # 10 seconds
faf init                                      # 5 seconds
# Total: ~45 seconds + local files
```

**1-Click Context:**
```bash
npx faf-cli git https://github.com/facebook/react
# Total: 2 seconds + ZERO local files
```

**This changes everything.** You can now generate AI context for repos you don't even own. 🏎️

---

## 💎 The Math

| Without `project.faf` | With `project.faf` |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| ~1,750 tokens/session verifying context | ~150 tokens once |
| Risk: wrong guess = 7,500+ tokens rework | Zero risk |
| Context drift accumulates | Drift impossible |
| Hope | Trust |

**91% fewer tokens. Zero risk. No drift.**

---

## 👥 Who is this for?

**Built for developers working with AI coding assistants:**
- Full-stack developers using Claude, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT
- Engineering teams collaborating on AI-augmented projects
- Solo developers tired of re-explaining context every session
- Open source maintainers wanting contributors to onboard instantly
- Anyone building with TypeScript, React, Python, Node.js, or modern frameworks

If you use AI to code, `project.faf` saves you time and tokens. Every project. Every session.

## ⚡ 1-Click Context - The KILLER Way

**Generate 90%+ AI context for ANY GitHub repo. No install. No clone. 2 seconds.**

```bash
# The revolutionary way - zero install required
npx faf-cli git https://github.com/facebook/react
# ⏱️ 2 seconds → 95% 🥈 Silver score

npx faf-cli git https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte
# ⏱️ 2 seconds → 95% 🥈 Silver score

npx faf-cli git https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
# ⏱️ 2 seconds → 90%+ context, ready for AI
```

**That's it. No install. No clone. Just instant AI-ready context.** 🏎️

---

### For Pros: Install Globally (Daily Use)

Once you're hooked, install globally for the full power:

```bash
# Install once
npm install -g faf-cli    # or: brew install faf-cli

# Then use short commands forever
faf git <repo-url>        # 1-Click Context (90%+)
faf go                    # Interactive to 100%
faf auto                  # Full automation
faf bi-sync               # Keep synced
# + 56 more commands
```

**Add to package.json** (see FAF status every dev session):
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "predev": "faf status --oneline"
  }
}
```

## What's New in v3.4.7 — Google Gemini Edition

Full interoperability with the Google Gemini ecosystem. One `.faf` file now works everywhere.

| Platform | Format | FAF Command |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md` | `faf gemini` |
| **Antigravity IDE** | `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` | `faf gemini --global` |
| **Conductor Extension** | `conductor/` directory | `faf conductor` |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | `faf bi-sync` |

```bash
# Import from Google formats
faf gemini import       # GEMINI.md → .faf
faf conductor import    # conductor/ → .faf

# Export to Google formats
faf gemini export       # .faf → GEMINI.md
faf conductor export    # .faf → conductor/

# Global Antigravity config
faf gemini --global     # ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md
```

**Universal AI Context** — Write once, use with Claude, Gemini CLI, Antigravity IDE, and Conductor.

---

## 🔄 Bi-Sync: `project.faf` ↔ `CLAUDE.md`

Your `project.faf` stays synchronized with `CLAUDE.md` in milliseconds.

```
project.faf  ←──── 8ms ────→  CLAUDE.md
     │                            │
     └── Single source of truth ──┘
```

```bash
faf bi-sync              # Sync once
faf bi-sync --watch      # Continuous sync
```

## 🎯 Slot-Ignore: The Perfect Way to Handle App Types

**Like `.gitignore` for files, slot-ignore for context slots.**

FAF has 21 slots. Some don't apply to your project type. **Slot-ignore** handles this elegantly:

```yaml
# CLI Tool - 21 slots total
stack:
  database: None           # ✅ Ignored (CLI doesn't need database)
  css_framework: None      # ✅ Ignored (no web UI)
  backend: Node.js         # ✅ Filled (has value)
  # ... other slots

Score: (Filled + Ignored) / 21 = 100% 🏆
```

**The formula:**
```
Total Slots: 21 (constant)
├── Filled: 15 (has values)
├── Ignored: 6 (set to 'None' - not applicable)
└── Missing: 0 (undefined - needs attention)

Score: (15 + 6) / 21 = 100%
```

**Common patterns:**
- **CLI Tools:** Ignore `database`, `css_framework`, `frontend`
- **Backend APIs:** Ignore `css_framework`, `frontend`, `ui_library`
- **Static Sites:** Ignore `backend`, `database`, `api_type`
- **Libraries:** Ignore `hosting`, `cicd`, `database`

**Full spec:** [docs/SLOT-IGNORE.md](./docs/SLOT-IGNORE.md)

## Boris-Flow Integration Tests

**Boris-Flow** is a 12-test validation suite that ensures faf-cli is demo-ready and safe to publish.

Named after Boris (Claude Code creator at Anthropic), these tests validate:
- Version detection works correctly
- Type and language detection (CLI, TypeScript, etc.)
- Claude Code structure detection (agents, skills, commands)
- Score progression: init → auto → 100%
- Non-TTY safety (no crashes when stdin is piped)

**When to run:**

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| **Before `faf init`** (on your project) | `./tests/boris-flow.test.sh` validates faf-cli works |
| **After major changes** to your `.faf` | Re-run to ensure structure is valid |
| **Before publishing** faf-cli updates | Required - ensures no regressions |
| **Before WJTTC certification** | Validates `.faf` file for Tier 8 |
| **Team onboarding** | Proves faf-cli installation works |

**Run Boris-Flow:**
```bash
# Clone faf-cli repository
git clone https://github.com/Wolfe-Jam/faf-cli
cd faf-cli

# Run integration tests
./tests/boris-flow.test.sh

# Expected output:
# 🏆 BORIS-FLOW: ALL 12 TESTS PASSED
# ✅ Demo ready
# ✅ Safe to publish
#    Final score: 100%
```

**What it tests:**
```bash
✅ faf --version
✅ Created Claude Code 2.1.0 structure
✅ faf init created project.faf
✅ Detected CLI type
✅ Language detected (TypeScript)
✅ claude_code section exists
✅ Claude Code detected: true
✅ Subagents detected (2+)
✅ Skills detected (1+)
✅ Commands detected (1+)
✅ faf auto maintained score
✅ human-set commands succeeded
✅ Final score is 100%
```

Boris-Flow validates the FAF file structure that WJTTC Tier 8 tests. Running it before certification helps ensure you'll pass Tier 8.

---

## Human Context (The 6 Ws)

Boost your score by 25-35% with human context — the information only YOU know.

```bash
# Auto-extract from README
faf readme --apply

# Manual entry
faf human-set who "Frontend team at Acme Corp"
faf human-set what "Customer dashboard with real-time analytics"
faf human-set why "10x faster than previous solution"
```

---

## CLI vs MCP

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **faf-cli** (this) | Terminal, scripts, CI/CD, automation |
| **claude-faf-mcp** | Claude Desktop via MCP protocol |

Same `project.faf`. Same scoring. Same result. Different execution layer.
