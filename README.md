# faf-cli

## TL;DR

**Problem:** AI needs persistent project context to work at its best.

**Solution:** The .faf format provides that context. This CLI creates, scores, and improves .faf files from your codebase.

**How it works:** Run `faf init` to create your .faf file. Get a score (0-100%) showing context quality. Higher scores = AI more in-tune with your project. Use `faf auto` and other commands to improve your score quickly. Align your .faf file with CLAUDE.md to maintain context persistently with bi-sync.

**Install:**
```bash
# npm (works everywhere)
npm install -g faf-cli

# Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install faf-cli
```

**Quick start:**
```bash
cd your-project
faf init        # Creates .faf file
faf score       # Check AI-readiness (0-100%)
```

**CLI vs MCP clarity**
- **faf-cli** (this): Runs on your machine locally in a terminal
- **claude-faf-mcp** ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/claude-faf-mcp)): Runs through Claude Desktop as a tool

Same .faf, different way to use. Same Project DNA and scoring. Same capabilities (create, score, improve). Different execution layer.

Use CLI for raw speed and local development; use MCP for AI-integrated workflows. No feature gaps between them - pick based on your flow.

## 🎉 What's New in v3.1.0

### 🔥 THE VISIBILITY REVOLUTION 🔥

**AI context just became UNIVERSAL. project.faf is here.**

For too long, `.faf` lived in the shadows - hidden, invisible, forgotten. **NOT ANYMORE.**

### 📂 Introducing: `project.faf`

## **`package.json` for AI**

**Just like `package.json` tells npm what your project needs...**
**`project.faf` tells AI what your project IS.**

| File | Purpose | Who Reads It |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `package.json` | Dependencies, scripts, metadata | npm, Node.js, developers |
| `project.faf` | **Context, architecture, purpose** | **AI, Claude, Cursor, any AI tool** |

**Same pattern. Same universality. Same necessity.**

**VISIBLE. DISCOVERABLE. UNIVERSAL.**

```bash
# The old way (hidden like .env)
ls -la
.env          # 🔒 Hidden (secrets - SHOULD be hidden)
.faf          # 👻 Hidden (AI context - SHOULD be visible!)

# The NEW WAY (visible like package.json)
ls
package.json  # ✅ Visible (dependencies - everyone needs to see)
project.faf   # ✅ Visible (AI context - AI needs to find this!)
.env          # 🔒 Still hidden (secrets stay secret)
```

**`.env` hides secrets. `project.faf` shares context.**

**`.faf` was hiding in the wrong category. `project.faf` fixes that.**

### 🚀 Why This Changes Everything

**Before:**
- Hidden `.faf` files easily forgotten
- Hard to discover in new projects
- "Wait, does this project have AI context?"
- Invisible to Git UIs, IDEs, file managers

**After:**
- `project.faf` sits next to `package.json`
- **IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS**
- Universal pattern developers already know
- Every project SHOWS its AI-readiness

### 🔺 The Golden Triangle

**Three sides. Closed loop. Complete accountability.**

```
         project.faf
          (WHAT IT IS)
              /    \
             /      \
            /        \
         repo    ←→   .taf
        (CODE)    (PROOF IT WORKS)
```

Every project needs three things:
- **Code that works** (repo)
- **Context for AI** (project.faf)
- **Proof it works** (.taf - git-tracked testing timeline)

**TAF** (Testing Audit File) format tracks every test run in git. On-the-fly CI/CD updates. Permanent audit trail. Unheard of in CI/CD.

**Traditional CI/CD:** Tests run → Results disappear → No permanent record
**TAF:** Tests run → .taf updates → Git commits → Permanent timeline

Format defined in **faf-taf-git** (GitHub Actions native support).

### ✨ The Essential Trio

```bash
your-project/
├── package.json    # What your project NEEDS (dependencies)
├── project.faf     # What your project IS (context for AI)
└── tsconfig.json   # How your project BUILDS (TypeScript config)
```

**`package.json`** → Tells npm: "Install these dependencies"
**`project.faf`** → Tells AI: "This is what I am, this is my purpose"
**`tsconfig.json`** → Tells TypeScript: "Compile with these settings"

**All visible. All universal. All essential.**

**You wouldn't skip `package.json`. Don't skip `project.faf`.**

### 🔥 New Commands

**1. `faf migrate` - Instant Upgrade**
```bash
faf migrate
# .faf → project.faf (27ms)
```

**2. `faf rename` - Bulk Power**
```bash
faf rename
# Recursively migrates ENTIRE monorepo tree
# Found 147 .faf files? ✅ Migrated in 420ms
```

**3. Auto-Magic for New Projects**
```bash
faf init    # Creates project.faf (not .faf)
faf auto    # Creates project.faf
```

### 🎯 Championship Detection Upgrade

**TSA Engine Integration** - "We're INSPECTORS, not trash collectors"

**Before (naive):**
```
Has 'commander' in package.json? → Maybe CLI
```

**After (championship):**
```
'commander' imported 10+ times? → DEFINITELY CLI
Analyzes CORE dependencies (actual usage)
95% accuracy vs 70% accuracy
```

### ⚡ Performance

- **migrate:** 27ms (54% faster than 50ms target)
- **rename:** 27ms for 3 files (73% faster than target)
- **championship grade** across all operations

### 🏆 WJTTC GOLD Certification

**97/100 Championship Score**
- Project Understanding: 20/20
- TURBO-CAT Knowledge: 20/20
- Architecture Understanding: 20/20

Full report: 194KB comprehensive test suite

### 🔙 100% Backward Compatible

**Still works with `.faf` files** - graceful transition, no breaking changes.

Your old `.faf` files keep working. Migrate when ready.

### 🌍 The Vision

**Every project with a `package.json` should have a `project.faf`**

Just like every TypeScript project has `tsconfig.json`, every Rust project has `Cargo.toml`, every Python project has `requirements.txt`...

**Every AI-augmented project has `project.faf`**

**This is the new universal standard for AI context.**

## 🏆 The Meta-Proof: Even Claude Forgot .FAF

**The AI that built FAF scored it at 12% without `.faf`.**

We created this tool together across thousands of conversations. Yet without project DNA, even Claude couldn't recognize its own work. That's the problem FAF solves.

### Before `.faf` - Birth: 12%
<div align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/faf-cli@latest/assets/birth-dna-12-percent.png" alt="FAF CLI birth score: 12% context" width="700" />
</div>

**Context Score: 12%** — Even the AI that built it couldn't recognize it

---

### The Transformation - 344ms Later
<div align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/faf-cli@latest/assets/faf-init-demo.gif" alt="Running faf init - 344ms" width="700" />
</div>

**`faf init`** — One command. Zero configuration. Project DNA created.

---

### After `.faf` - Current: 89%
<div align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/faf-cli@latest/assets/growth-to-89-percent.png" alt="FAF CLI after .faf: 89% context score" width="700" />
</div>

**Context Score: 89%** — Instant comprehension. Persistent memory.

**+77% improvement in 344ms.** That's what project DNA does for ANY AI, ANY project.

## 🎯 What is FAF?

**`.faf` = Project DNA ✨ for AI**

Universal, shareable AI context that works with **Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor** - regardless of your stack, size, or setup.

### Why Context Quality Matters

**At 99% context quality**, AI knows exactly what you're building and helps at optimal levels—trusted decisions, accurate suggestions, championship performance.

**At 55% context quality**, you're flipping a coin on every decision. It's like handing a builder only half a blueprint and discussing it in a totally foreign language.

FAF's **Professional 0→99% Podium Scoring System** makes context collection measurable, fun, and championship-grade. Track your project's evolution from 🤍 Heart (0%) to 🏆 Trophy (100%).

### The REAL Problem: Project Health

**This isn't about saving 20 minutes at setup.**

Running projects on LOW AI context leads to:
- ❌ **Project death** (worst case)
- ❌ **Delays, costs, stress, heartache, disappointment**
- ❌ **Wasted time, resources, and money**
- ❌ **Poor outcomes for stakeholders and users**
- ❌ **Burnout from constant re-explaining**

**It's not a one-time config. It's a relationship.**

A healthy Human + AI collaboration requires **high-quality, persistent context**. Without it, every interaction is a gamble. Every decision is questionable. Every suggestion needs verification.

**Ignoring poor context on your project is like not brushing your child's teeth.**

You're gonna end up with a **CAVITY**.

### The Solution: Project DNA

- ✅ **Podium context** (85-99% quality scores)
- ✅ **Persistent intelligence** - AI remembers your project perfectly
- ✅ **Seamless collaboration** - Human + AI working together optimally
- ✅ **Project health monitoring** - Track context quality over time
- ✅ **Works with every AI** - Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, all of them
- ✅ **Team alignment** - Everyone (human AND AI) on the same page

```bash
faf chat        # Requires interactive terminal
faf             # Interactive menu (use faf auto instead)
```

**Why?** Interactive commands use `inquirer` for beautiful CLI menus. These work in regular terminals but AI assistants can't forward keyboard input. **This is expected behavior.**

**Solution:** Use `faf auto` - it's designed for AI assistants! ⚡

## 🏎️ The .faf Pattern

### Why .faf vs RAG?

**.faf is pre-indexed intelligence.** Do the work once, use it forever.

| Aspect | RAG Approach | .faf Approach |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Indexing** | Runtime embedding (slow, $) | One-time at creation (fast, free) |
| **Retrieval** | Vector search per query ($) | Instant file read (free) |
| **Quality** | Probabilistic, incomplete | Structured, validated, scored |
| **Latency** | Seconds (embedding + search) | Milliseconds (<50ms) |
| **Cost** | Per-query fees | Zero runtime cost |
| **Versioning** | Difficult | Git-friendly YAML |

**.faf is RAG's output—captured once, reused infinitely.** Podium efficiency.

### Universal Pattern

Every source follows the same pattern:

```
interrogation → extraction → filtering → generation → .faf
```

**In FREE CLI:** Code projects → .faf (all languages, frameworks, stacks)

**In TURBO:** Automation platforms → .faf (n8n, OpenAI Assistants, Opal, Make.com)

Same pattern. Same output. Universal by design.
