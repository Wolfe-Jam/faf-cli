## ‚ö° Codex Quick Commands (Your Shortcuts)

```bash
# Your essentials - always use -q
faf init -q          # Initialize quietly
faf auto -q          # Auto-enhance quietly

## üéØ Codex-Specific Features in v2.4.5

- Minimal output
- Clean for parsing

### 2. Smart Refusals
- Won't run in home/root directories
- Asks for project context
- Protects against accidents

### 3. Sandbox-Friendly
- `scripts/clean-build.js` works in restricted environments
- No `sysconf` errors
- Cross-platform compatible

### 4. Documentation Placement
- README.md:3 - Your instructions are FIRST
- README.md:66 - Your quickstart guide
- This index - Your command reference

## üìã Codex Workflow

1. **Check Installation**
   ```bash
   faf --version  # Should show 2.4.5+
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project  # NEVER run in home
   ```

3. **Initialize Quietly**
   ```bash
   faf init -q  # Creates .faf
   ```

4. **Enhance Automatically**
   ```bash
   faf auto -q  # Improves context
   ```

5. **Check Score**
   ```bash
   faf score -q  # See AI readiness
   ```

## üõÇ Codex Special: TSA Mode

```bash
faf tsa -q  # Inspect dependencies
```

This runs our secret dependency inspector in quiet mode - perfect for understanding package bloat without verbose output.

## üí° Codex Pro Tips

1. **Always use `-q`** - It's made for you
2. **Run in project directories** - Not home/root
3. **Chain commands** - `faf init -q && faf auto -q`
4. **Check help** - `faf --help | grep "\-q"`

## üîß Troubleshooting for Codex

### "Cannot run in home directory"
- Solution: `cd` to your actual project

### "Command not found"
- Solution: `npm install -g faf-cli`

### Too much output
- Solution: Add `-q` to every command

## üèÜ Why This Works

You're not using a "Codex version" - you're using THE FAF v2.4.5 with pathways optimized for AI assistants. Same powerful engine, streamlined interface.

It's like having a Formula 1 car with two modes:
- **Normal Mode**: Full experience with banners
- **Codex Mode (-q)**: Streamlined for efficiency

Both modes use the SAME championship engine!

**Remember**: This is YOUR index. The same FAF everyone uses, but with YOUR optimal paths highlighted.
