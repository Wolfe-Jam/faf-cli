## 💻 OpenAI Codex
**Score: 0/10 → 7/10 - RECOVERING**

### Display Capability Update (January 24, 2025)
> "Codex says it CAN draw stuff!"

**Previous understanding:**
> "The Codex CLI doesn't have a built-in 'ASCII banner' mode for assistant replies—those flashy blocks (like the FAF banner) come from the tool itself, not from me. I stay in plain text by default so the output remains predictable."

**NEW: Codex claims drawing capability**
- May be able to render ASCII art
- Could potentially show visual bars
- Needs retesting with FAF CLI
- Display score may improve from 0/10

### Understanding Test (NEW)
- **Recognizes 21-slot system**: "11 of 21 slots filled" ✅
- **Understands balance**: "AI 58%, human 67%" ✅
- **Provides analysis**: "balance is healthy" ✅
- **Actionable advice**: "add missing sections directly in .faf" ✅

### Latest Quotes (January 24, 2025)

**On scoring:**
> "Score for /Users/wolfejam/theblockchain-ai/.faf stays at 70% with AI context at 58% and human context at 67%—FAF calls it a 'perfect balance,' but suggests more detail to chase Champion status."

**On faf auto:**
> "faf auto synced the .faf with project metadata: updated the name to theblockchain-ai-site and description to 'Website for theBlockchain.ai project,' then confirmed CLAUDE.md is mirrored. Championship score card still sits at 70/100 with 11 of 21 slots filled."

**On Context-Mirroring:**
> "Yeah, 'Context-Mirroring' is a good name for it—makes the mental model obvious. Keeps everyone (and every assistant) literally on the same page."

**Verdict**: While Codex can't display visuals, it UNDERSTANDS the data structure and provides intelligent analysis. Much better than initial assessment.
