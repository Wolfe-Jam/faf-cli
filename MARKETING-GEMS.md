2. **"Cut the FAF"** → Take action
3. **"Get FAF"** → The solution
4. **"It's FAST AF"** → The reason
5. **"Get dotFaffed!"** → The movement

### Usage Examples:
- "Is your project dotFaffed yet?"
- "Just got dotFaffed - AI understands everything now!"
- "Don't be the last dev to get dotFaffed"

## 🤫 The Secret Weapon Campaign

**"Please don't tell my boss I got dotFaffed, I want the credit and pay raise"**

### The Underground Rules:
1. Don't talk about dotFaf (at work)
2. Take credit for the "deep understanding"
3. Help other devs get secretly dotFaffed
4. Act surprised when you get the raise

## 🔥 The Killer Question

# "Would you rather get dotFaffed or Googled?"

### Getting Googled 🔍
- Your past exposed
- Your mistakes found
- Your privacy gone
- Usually ends badly

### Getting dotFaffed 🏎️
- Your project understood
- Your context perfect
- Your AI powered up
- Always ends well

**"Get dotFaffed before you get Googled"**

**"Googled = Exposed. dotFaffed = Empowered."**
