## Common Questions

**Q: How big should my .faf file be?**
A: Usually 2-5KB. If it's over 10KB, you're overdoing it.

**Q: Does it work with private repos?**
A: Yes. The .faf file contains context, not code.

**Q: What if my project changes?**
A: Run `faf sync` to update. Or use `faf watch` for auto-updates.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: The .faf file is local. You control what goes in it.

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"
```bash
# Check if installed
npm list -g faf-cli

### "No .faf file found"
```bash
# You're probably in wrong directory
pwd  # Check current directory

# Or create one
faf init
```
