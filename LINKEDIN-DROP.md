## Best Practices for LinkedIn

### ✅ DO:
- Use the orange heart and lightning emojis 🧡⚡️
- Include "faf.one" as plain text (LinkedIn makes it clickable)
- Add relevant hashtags: #dotfaffed #AI #DeveloperTools
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include the question format to spark curiosity

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't use markdown syntax (LinkedIn doesn't support it)
- Don't use HTML (LinkedIn strips it)
- Don't make it too salesy
- Don't forget the emojis (they grab attention in the feed)

## Copy-Paste Champion

The absolute easiest for any LinkedIn context:
```
Have you been dot.faffed yet? 🧡⚡️ → faf.one
```

This works everywhere on LinkedIn:
- Posts

**Pro tip:** LinkedIn automatically makes "faf.one" clickable, so you don't need any special formatting. Just paste and go! 🧡⚡️
