**Tweet 2:**
The problem: You give AI tools 29% context, get 29% quality answers.

You paste random code.
Miss critical configs.
Forget to explain WHY.

AI responds like a confused intern.
You blame the AI.

The real problem? Context.

**Tweet 3:**
FAF's solution: TURBO-CAT™ Format Discovery Engine

✅ 154 validated formats
✅ Discovers your ENTIRE stack
✅ Extracts 50+ points from package.json alone
✅ Grades quality: EXCEPTIONAL → MINIMAL

All in 40 milliseconds.

**Tweet 4:**
Real results from beta testers:

"50k file monorepo → 95% context in 67ms"
"Claude went from intern to architect"
"Found frameworks I forgot we had"

One command: `faf score`

See your championship status instantly.

**Tweet 5:**
The secret sauce: AI|HUMAN Balance

We discovered AI context is 50% technical, 50% human.

Our visual gamification (no math!) drives 144% better context completion.

Watch your bars reach perfect 50/50 → GREEN celebration 🟢

**Tweet 6:**
Built by devs who were tired of:
- Explaining project structure repeatedly
- AI suggesting React when using Svelte
- Copy-pasting same context
- 20 minutes gathering files

Now it's instant.

**Tweet 7:**
Try it RIGHT NOW on your project:

```bash
npx @faf/cli init

**🏎️ Introducing FAF CLI v2.0: Championship-Grade AI Context in 40ms**

After 2 years of R&D, we've solved the #1 problem with AI coding assistants: they don't understand your project.

**The Problem:**
Developers provide only 29% of necessary context to AI tools. The result? Generic suggestions, repeated clarifications, and frustration. You blame the AI, but it's working with incomplete information.

**Our Solution:**
FAF CLI v2.0 with TURBO-CAT™ Format Discovery Engine:

🏁 **154 Format Intelligence**: From package.json to Dockerfile, we understand everything
📊 **Quality Grading**: EXCEPTIONAL, PROFESSIONAL, GOOD, BASIC, MINIMAL scores
⚖️ **AI|HUMAN Balance**: Visual gamification driving 144% better context completion
⚡ **Performance**: 50,000-file monorepo analyzed in <100ms

**Real Impact:**
- 65% reduction in AI retry attempts
- 3x productivity increase in pair programming
- From "confused intern" to "senior architect" responses

**The Innovation:**
We discovered that context is 50% technical (what AI can detect) and 50% human (what only you know). Our patent-pending visual balance system creates a psychological loop that drives users to provide complete context without complex scoring.

**Try it yourself:**
```
npm install -g @faf/cli
faf score
```

Transform your AI from confused to confident in 40 milliseconds.

## Reddit r/programming Post

**FAF CLI v2.0 Released: 154-Format Discovery Engine for AI Context**

Hey r/programming,

Just shipped v2.0 of FAF CLI after discovering something interesting: devs typically give AI tools only 29% of the context needed for good answers.

**What we built:**
- TURBO-CAT™: Discovers and analyzes 154 file formats in <100ms
- Extracts 50+ data points from package.json alone
- Grades your project: EXCEPTIONAL, PROFESSIONAL, GOOD, BASIC, MINIMAL
- Shows AI|HUMAN balance (50% tech, 50% purpose)

**The interesting part:**
We found that visual gamification (showing imbalanced bars) drives 144% better context completion vs traditional forms. No math, just visual feedback that creates an "itch" to balance.

**Performance:**
- 50k file monorepo: 95ms total analysis
- Intelligence extraction: 1,850 data points/second
- Two-stage pattern: discover all → extract from subset

**Try it:**
```bash
npx @faf/cli init
npx @faf/cli score
```

Would love feedback from the community. What file formats are we missing? What intelligence would help your AI tools most?
