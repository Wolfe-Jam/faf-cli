## 🎯 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. ✅ Double-Rendering Bug FIXED
- **Issue**: ASCII art card appearing TWICE (start and end)
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate `generateFAFHeader()` calls from:
  - `version.ts` (line 10)
  - `formats.ts` (line 18)
  - `init.ts` (lines 47-50)
- **Result**: Card now appears ONLY ONCE per command
- **Verified**: 5x stress test shows consistent single rendering

### 2. ✅ Branding Updates Applied
- **"Championship Edition"** → **"Podium Edition 🏁"**
- **"Format Discovery"** → **"--Prowling..."** (TURBO-CAT)
- Both changes tested and working
