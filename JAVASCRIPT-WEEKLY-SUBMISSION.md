# ðŸ“§ JavaScript Weekly Submission

**To:** peter@cooperpress.com
**Subject:** Tool Submission: .faf - JPEG for AI Context (1,000+ weekly downloads)

Hi Peter,

I'd like to submit our tool for JavaScript Weekly consideration.

## .faf - The JPEG for AIâ„¢

**What it does:** Transforms any JavaScript/Node project into AI-ready context in under 3 minutes, solving the "20-minute explanation problem" developers face with AI assistants.

**The Hook:** Our Claude Desktop MCP integration just hit 800+ weekly downloads, with developers reporting 6.7x faster AI interactions.

**Technical Interest:**
- Zero-dependency core engine (pure TypeScript)
- <50ms processing on large codebases
- Intelligent format detection (154+ types including .js, .ts, .jsx, .json)
- Real-time AI-readiness scoring

**Quick Demo:**
```bash
npm install -g faf-cli
cd any-js-project
faf auto
# Instant .faf file with complete project context
```

**Ecosystem:**
- CLI: `faf-cli` (201 weekly downloads)
- MCP: `claude-faf-mcp` (800+ weekly downloads)
- Combined: 1,000+ developers weekly

**Links:**
- NPM: https://npmjs.com/package/faf-cli
- MCP: https://npmjs.com/package/claude-faf-mcp
- Docs: https://faf.one

**Why it matters for JS developers:**
Every JavaScript developer using AI loses hours weekly to context setup. We've standardized this into a 3-minute, one-command process. Think "Prettier for AI context."

**Sample one-liner for newsletter:**
".faf brings JPEG-like standardization to AI context - transform any Node project into AI-ready format in 3 minutes"

Thanks for considering!

[Your name]
