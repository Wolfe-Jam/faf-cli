## The Psychology Wins

1. **Anchoring**: $100 makes $9 feel like theft
2. **Scarcity**: Limited spots at each tier
3. **Loss Aversion**: "Miss $9, pay $19"
4. **Social Proof**: Live counter shows demand
5. **Commitment**: Lifetime lock creates loyalty

---

## Revenue Projection (Conservative)

### With $100 Anchoring:
- Tier 1 (100 @ $9): 95% fill rate = $855/mo
- Tier 2 (100 @ $19): 90% fill rate = $1,710/mo
- Tier 3 (100 @ $29): 85% fill rate = $2,465/mo
- Tier 4 (100 @ $39): 80% fill rate = $3,120/mo
- Total first 400: $8,150/mo

### Without Anchoring (just $9):
- 400 users @ $9: 60% fill rate = $2,160/mo

**3.8x better with $100 anchoring!**

---

## The Master Narrative

"FAF is $100/month professional software.

We're giving MCP early adopters a chance to lock in 91% off forever.

Not because FAF is worth $9.
Because early adopters are worth rewarding.

First 100 get $9. Forever.
Next 100 get $19. Forever.
Then $29, $39, $49...

At 1,000 users, it's $100 for everyone.

Your move."
