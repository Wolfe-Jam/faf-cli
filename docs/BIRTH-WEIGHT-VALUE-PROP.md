- **Original Score**: Smaller, gray, but ALWAYS there
- **Growth**: Highlighted when impressive

### Color Coding
```typescript
function getGrowthColor(growth: number): Color {
  if (growth > 70) return chalk.green;   // 🟢 Incredible
  if (growth > 50) return chalk.cyan;    // 🔵 Excellent
  if (growth > 30) return chalk.yellow;  // 🟡 Good
  if (growth > 10) return chalk.white;   // ⚪ Progress
  return chalk.gray;                     // 🔘 Starting
}
```

  options: DisplayOptions = {}
) {
  const birthWeight = dna.birth_certificate.birth_weight;
  const growth = current - birthWeight;
  const daysSinceBirth = getDaysSince(dna.birth_certificate.born);
  const dailyGrowth = growth / daysSinceBirth;

  // Always show both
  console.log(formatCurrentScore(current));
  console.log(formatBirthWeight(birthWeight, dna.birth_certificate.born));

  // Show growth if significant
  if (growth > 10) {
    console.log(formatGrowth(growth, dailyGrowth));
  }
