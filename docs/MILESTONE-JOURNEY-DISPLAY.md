## 🎮 Gamification Through Milestones

### Standard Milestones
```typescript
const MILESTONES = {
  birth: { label: "Birth", emoji: "🐣" },
  first_growth: { label: "First Growth", emoji: "🌱", threshold: 30 },
  doubled: { label: "Doubled", emoji: "2️⃣", condition: (current, birth) => current >= birth * 2 },
  first_save: { label: "First Save", emoji: "💾" },
  championship: { label: "Championship", emoji: "🏆", threshold: 70 },
  elite: { label: "Elite", emoji: "⭐", threshold: 85 },
  peak: { label: "Peak", emoji: "🏔️" },
  perfect: { label: "Perfect", emoji: "💎", threshold: 100 }
};
```

### Adaptive Milestone Display
```typescript
function displayJourney(fafDNA: FafDNA) {
  const milestones = fafDNA.milestones;

  // Compact view (for status bar)
  const compact = `${milestones.birth}% → ${milestones.firstSave}% → ${milestones.peak}% ← ${milestones.current}%`;

  // Detailed view (for dedicated commands)
  const detailed = milestones.map(m =>
    `${m.emoji} ${m.label}: ${m.score}% (${formatDate(m.date)})`
  ).join('\n');

  return { compact, detailed };
}
```

## 🎯 The Psychology of Milestones

### Why This Works

1. **Loss Aversion**: "I was at 99%! I can get back there!"
2. **Progress Validation**: "Look how far I've come"
3. **Social Proof**: "My journey is impressive"
4. **Goal Setting**: "If I hit 99% before, I can hit 100%"
5. **Pride**: "22% to 92% - that's MY achievement"
