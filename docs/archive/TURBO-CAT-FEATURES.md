# 🎯 TURBO-CAT™ FEATURES - Current vs Future

## ✅ WHAT TURBO-CAT DOES NOW (v2.0.0)

### 1. **Format Detection**
- Scans project for 154 validated file formats
- Returns list of discovered formats
- Shows which formats are confirmed (actually contain valid content)

### 2. **Stack Identification**
- Generates stack signature (e.g., "react-typescript-node-postgres")
- Shows framework confidence scores
- Maps formats to their frameworks

### 3. **Intelligence Scoring**
- Calculates total intelligence score based on formats found
- Shows how many "slots" are filled (completeness)
- Provides metadata for AI context generation

### 4. **Format Listing** (`faf formats` command)
- Lists all discovered formats in your project
- Shows them by category (pyramid levels)
- Displays alphabetical listing
- Exports to JSON if needed

### 5. **Analysis Output**
```javascript
{
  discoveredFormats: [...],      // What we found
  confirmedFormats: [...],       // What's actually valid
  totalIntelligenceScore: 85,    // How complete
  frameworkConfidence: {...},    // What frameworks detected
  stackSignature: "next-node"    // Your stack in a string
}
```

## 🎯 Current Commands That Work

```bash
# These work NOW:
faf formats           # List discovered formats
faf formats --export  # Export as JSON
faf score            # Get intelligence score with TURBO-CAT boost
faf init            # Generate .faf with TURBO-CAT intelligence

# These DON'T exist (yet):
faf clean           # ❌ Future feature
faf validate        # ❌ Future feature
faf fix            # ❌ Future feature
faf migrate        # ❌ Future feature
```

## 📣 The Truth

**TURBO-CAT v2.0.0 is a detection and analysis engine.**

It FINDS and REPORTS.
It doesn't FIX or CLEAN (yet).

But what it does, it does VERY well:
- Fast detection (<200ms)
- 154 validated formats
- Accurate stack signatures
- Reliable intelligence scoring

## 🚀 Roadmap Philosophy

**Better to do a few things PERFECTLY than many things POORLY.**

Current focus:
1. Detection accuracy
2. Analysis quality
3. Performance speed

Future focus (when ready):
1. Cleaning capabilities
2. Validation depth
3. Auto-fixing
