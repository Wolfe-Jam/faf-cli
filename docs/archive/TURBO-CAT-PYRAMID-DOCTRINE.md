# üî∫ TURBO-CAT‚Ñ¢ FORMAT PYRAMID DOCTRINE
## The 154 Format Covenant

### üìú THE SACRED DECLARATION

**We SHALL maintain exactly 154 formats in the Format Pyramid.**

**We PROMISE to crack the code (add) ANY new format - BUT ONLY IF:**
The requester can PROVE there is not a better format already in the Pyramid that serves the same purpose!

=====================
Total: 1+2+3...+17 = 153
+ TURBO-CAT itself = 154
```

## üìã THE ADMISSION PROCESS

### To Add a New Format:

1. **IDENTIFY** - What format do you want added?
2. **JUSTIFY** - Why is it essential?
3. **COMPARE** - Show it's not redundant with existing 154
4. **PROVE** - Demonstrate it's BETTER than what we have
5. **REPLACE** - If approved, it kicks out a weaker format

### The Challenge Questions:
- ‚ùì "Is there not already a format that does this?"
- ‚ùì "Which of our 154 is it superior to?"
- ‚ùì "Does it deserve a pyramid stone?"

## üèÜ THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Quality Over Quantity**
We're not collecting Pokemon - we're curating excellence.

### 2. **Every Stone Matters**
Each of the 154 formats must earn its place.

### 3. **Survival of the Fittest**
New formats must DEFEAT existing ones to enter.

### 4. **The Catalyst Promise**
We CAN process ANY format - we CHOOSE only the worthy 154.

## üìä CURRENT PYRAMID STATUS

**Base Tier (17-stone foundation):**
- Package managers (npm, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Ultra-high value configs

**Middle Tiers (descending stones):**
- Framework configs
- Build tools
- Testing frameworks

**Apex (1 stone):**
- üòΩ TURBO-CAT itself

## üéØ FORMAT CHALLENGE EXAMPLES

### ‚ùå REJECTED:
**Request:** "Add my-custom-config.xml"
**Response:** "package.json already handles Node configs better."

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTED:
**Request:** "Add bun.lockb for Bun runtime"
**Response:** "Replaces obsolete bower.json - APPROVED!"

## üîÆ THE ETERNAL PROMISE

*"We are the Format Freaks - we SHALL decode ANY format,*
*but only the WORTHY 154 earn a pyramid stone!"*

---

## üìú THE FORMAT FREAK OATH

```
We, the keepers of TURBO-CAT,
Swear by the Sacred Pyramid of 154,
To catalyze ANY format brought before us,
But to enshrine only the worthy,
For we are the Format Freaks,
And quality is our catalyst!
