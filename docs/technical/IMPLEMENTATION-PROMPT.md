## üõ† Cross-Platform Adapter Requirements

### Shared Engine Integration:
1. **Engine API Client:** Standardized faf-engine-mk1 communication layer
2. **Adapter Interface:** Consistent pattern for platform‚Üíengine translation  
3. **Performance Passthrough:** Maintain engine's <30ms response characteristics (championship speed)
4. **State Synchronization:** Leverage engine's existing file watching and caching
5. **Error Translation:** Convert engine errors to platform-appropriate messages

### Adapter Development Standards:
- **Lightweight Design:** Adapters should be thin protocol translation layers
- **Engine-First:** Leverage existing engine capabilities, don't duplicate logic
- **Platform-Native:** Each adapter feels native while calling proven engine APIs
- **Consistent Interface:** Standardized adapter‚Üíengine communication patterns
- **Performance Preservation:** Adapters should not degrade engine performance

## üí≠ Planning Questions to Address

### Adapter Architecture:
1. Should adapters call faf-engine-mk1 via CLI, API, or direct library integration?
2. How do we standardize adapter interfaces while preserving platform idioms?
3. What's the optimal adapter caching strategy to complement engine performance?
4. How do we ensure consistent UX through adapter translation layers?

### Development Process:
1. Which adapter pattern should we establish first to guide other implementations?
2. How do we balance adapter-specific features vs. engine API limitations?
3. What testing strategy validates adapter‚Üíengine communication reliability?
4. How do we manage adapter documentation while leveraging engine docs?

### Go-to-Market:
1. What's the launch sequence that maximizes adoption and word-of-mouth?
2. How do we position FAF differently for each platform's community?
3. What partnerships or endorsements would accelerate adoption?
4. How do we measure success across platforms with different metrics?

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Choose Starting Adapter:** Validate which adapter to build first based on:
   - Protocol complexity vs. engine API compatibility  
   - Adapter implementation effort vs. user impact
   - Platform readiness for external integrations

2. **Adapter Pattern Decisions:** Establish core adapter architecture:
   - CLI vs. API vs. library integration with faf-engine-mk1
   - Error handling and performance preservation patterns
   - Standardized adapter interface design

3. **Prototype Development:** Build minimal viable adapter for chosen platform:
   - Core engine API integration only
   - Platform-native installation process
   - Basic error translation layer

4. **Community Engagement:** Begin platform-specific outreach:
   - Share adapter approach for technical feedback
   - Identify platform-specific integration requirements
   - Validate engine API coverage for platform needs
