# üíé FAF: 10x Claude at Half the Price

## The Reality Check

**Claude MAX**: $200/month for... longer context windows?
**FAF + Claude**: $100/month for PERFECT context forever

---

## What Claude MAX Gives You

### For $200/month:
- Longer context windows
- Priority access
- More messages
- Same confusion with bad context
- Same "let me start over" problems
- Same context loss between sessions

**It's a faster car with no GPS.**

---

## What FAF Gives You

### For $100/month:
- **100% Context** - Not longer windows, PERFECT understanding
- **Context-Mirroring** - Never lose context between sessions
- **RelentlessContextExtractor** - Hunts down every detail
- **AI|HUMAN Balance** - Psychological perfection
- **FAB-FORMATS** - 150+ file intelligence
- **.faf Standard** - Universal context format

**It's GPS + Autopilot + Pit Crew.**

## The 10x Multiplier Effect

### Claude WITHOUT FAF:
```
You: "Help me add authentication"
Claude: "What framework are you using?"
You: "React"
Claude: "What auth system?"
You: "JWT"
Claude: "What backend?"
You: [20 more questions...]
Result: Generic solution, 30 minutes wasted
```

### Claude WITH FAF:
```
You: "Help me add authentication"
Claude: [Reads .faf - knows EVERYTHING]
Result: Perfect solution for YOUR stack in 30 seconds
```

**30 minutes ‚Üí 30 seconds = 60x faster**
**Generic ‚Üí Specific = ‚àû better**

---

## Context-Mirroring: The Game Changer

### What Anthropic CAN'T Solve:
- Context dies at session boundary
- Can't share context between projects
- No memory between conversations
- Start from zero every time

### What FAF DOES Solve:
```yaml
.faf ‚Üê‚Üí CLAUDE.md (Bi-directional sync)
     ‚Üì
Perfect context in EVERY session
Never explain twice
Shared across team
Travels with code
```

**This is technically impossible for Claude to do internally.**
**FAF does it externally, perfectly.**

---

## Relentless-Engine Modes

### Claude's Limitation:
- Waits for you to provide context
- Asks questions one at a time
- Passive understanding
- Accepts incomplete information

### FAF's Relentless Modes:
1. **Hunt Mode** - Actively searches for context
2. **Extract Mode** - Pulls intelligence from 150+ formats
3. **Balance Mode** - Forces human context completion
4. **Mirror Mode** - Syncs between sessions
5. **Champion Mode** - Won't accept <99% context

**Claude becomes AGGRESSIVE about understanding.**
