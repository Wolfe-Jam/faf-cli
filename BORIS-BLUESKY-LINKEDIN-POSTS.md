### Full Post:
```
🙏 A Public Thank You to Boris and the Claude Code Team

I wanted to share how Claude Code was instrumental in building the .faf ecosystem, which just crossed 1,000 weekly downloads.

The Impact Claude Code Had:
• Helped refactor complex TypeScript into a zero-dependency core
• Multi-file operations that actually work
• Todo system that kept me organized during 12-hour sessions
• Caught edge cases I would have missed

The most magical moment was extracting a zero-dependency package from a complex codebase in one session. What would have taken days was done in hours.

What We Built with Claude Code's Help:
• .faf - Universal AI context format (like JPEG for AI)
• MCP server for Claude Desktop (800+ weekly downloads)
• CLI tool (201+ weekly downloads)
• <50ms processing on any codebase

To the Claude Code team: Thank you for building something that doesn't just assist with code - it transforms how we build.

If you haven't tried .faf yet:
npm install -g faf-cli claude-faf-mcp

## Posting Strategy

1. **Bluesky** - Post the thread, tag Boris if you found his handle
2. **LinkedIn** - Professional visibility, might get shared
3. **GitHub** - If you find the repo, open a "Thank You" issue
4. **Twitter/X** - Cross-post for maximum reach

The public thank you might be even more valuable than a private email - it helps both projects!
