# 📁 The ~/.faf Directory Strategy

## We Actually Create It!

When users run `faf email`, we:
1. **Actually create** `~/.faf/backups/` directory
2. **Actually save** a timestamped backup copy
3. **Actually store** their email in `~/.faf/config.json`

## Directory Structure
```
~/.faf/
├── config.json          # User preferences, email, settings
├── backups/            # Timestamped .faf backups
│   ├── project_2025-01-17T10-30-45.faf
│   ├── myapp_2025-01-17T14-22-13.faf
│   └── ...
├── cache/              # Trust scores, performance data
├── templates/          # User's custom .faf templates
└── achievements/       # Gamification data (future)
```

## Why This Is Brilliant

1. **Real Value**: We're not just saying we backup - we DO IT
2. **User Ownership**: Their data, their backups, their control
3. **Future Features**:
   - Version history browsing
   - Rollback to previous .faf versions
   - Template library
   - Achievement tracking
   - Global settings

## Current Implementation

```typescript
// In email.ts - we actually do this:
const backupDir = path.join(require('os').homedir(), '.faf', 'backups');
const backupPath = path.join(backupDir, backupFileName);
await fs.mkdir(backupDir, { recursive: true });
await fs.writeFile(backupPath, fafContent);
```

## Future Commands Using ~/.faf

```bash
faf history              # Browse backup history
faf restore 2025-01-17   # Restore from backup
faf config               # Global settings
faf templates            # Manage templates
faf achievements         # View unlocked achievements
```

## The Psychology

- Users see we CREATE real backups = trust
- Users see organized directory = professional
- Users can browse their backups = control
- Users accumulate history = investment

**We're not just sending emails - we're building a LOCAL ecosystem they'll value!**

*The ~/.faf directory becomes their personal FAF vault - another reason to keep using the tool*
