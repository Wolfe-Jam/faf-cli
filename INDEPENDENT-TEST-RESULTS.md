# üèÅ Independent Test Results - @faf/core Extraction
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Branch:** core-extraction-preventive-fixes
**Tester:** Automated Test Suite

## üìä Executive Summary
Proving the extraction is SUPERIOR, not just equivalent.

---

## üß™ Test Protocol

### 1. Baseline Capture (Current v2.1.5)
```bash
# Capture exact behavior BEFORE changes
npm test > baseline/test-results-v2.1.5.txt
npm run test:audit > baseline/audit-v2.1.5.txt

# Score consistency check
for project in test-fixtures/*; do
  faf score "$project" --json > "baseline/score-$project.json"
done

# Performance baseline
time faf auto /tmp/perf-test > baseline/performance.txt
```

### 2. After Extraction Tests
```bash
# Same tests with extracted core
npm test > extracted/test-results.txt
npm run test:audit > extracted/audit.txt

# Score MUST be identical
for project in test-fixtures/*; do
  faf score "$project" --json > "extracted/score-$project.json"
  diff "baseline/score-$project.json" "extracted/score-$project.json"
done
```

### 3. Superiority Metrics

| Metric | Before (v2.1.5) | After (w/ @faf/core) | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Bundle Size** | TBD | TBD | Target: -30% |
| **Install Time** | TBD | TBD | Target: -20% |
| **Score Calculation** | TBD | TBD | Target: <50ms |
| **Memory Usage** | TBD | TBD | Target: -25% |
| **Test Coverage** | TBD | TBD | Target: 95%+ |
| **Type Safety** | TBD | TBD | Target: 100% |
| **MCP Compatibility** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚àû Better |

## üéØ Critical Success Criteria

### MUST PASS (Deal Breakers):
- [ ] All existing tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Score calculations identical (¬±0%)
- [ ] No breaking changes to CLI API
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] All commands still work

### SHOULD ACHIEVE (Superiority):
- [ ] Faster performance (>10% improvement)
- [ ] Smaller bundle size (>20% reduction)
- [ ] Better test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Cleaner architecture (measurable)
- [ ] MCP server works with core only

## üî¨ Independent Verification

### A/B Testing Protocol
1. Install current v2.1.5 globally
2. Test 100 real projects, capture scores
3. Install extracted version
4. Re-test same 100 projects
5. Compare results byte-for-byte

### Statistical Analysis
- Mean score deviation: TARGET 0.00%
- Standard deviation: TARGET 0.00
- Max deviation: TARGET 0.00%
- Confidence level: 99.99%

## üèÜ Superiority Proof Points

### 1. Architecture Quality
- **Before:** Monolithic, 216 commander uses across 38 files
- **After:** Clean separation, core has zero CLI dependencies
- **Verdict:** PENDING

### 2. Maintainability
- **Before:** Circular dependencies, global state
- **After:** Dependency injection, functional core
- **Verdict:** PENDING

### 3. Performance
- **Before:** TBD baseline
- **After:** TBD measurement
- **Verdict:** PENDING

### 4. Extensibility
- **Before:** CLI-only usage
- **After:** MCP, Browser, Mobile possible
- **Verdict:** PENDING

---

## üö® Risk Assessment

### What Could Go Wrong?
1. Score calculation drift (CRITICAL)
2. Performance regression (HIGH)
3. Breaking changes missed (HIGH)
4. Type incompatibilities (MEDIUM)
5. Test coverage gaps (LOW)

### Mitigation Results
- [ ] Preventive fixes applied
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] A/B testing complete
