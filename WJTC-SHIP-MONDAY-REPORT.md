## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Power Unit (FAB-FORMATS)
```typescript
// /Users/wolfejam/FAF/cli/src/engines/fab-formats-processor.ts
export class FabFormatsProcessor {
  // 150+ file handlers
  // Quality grading system
  // Two-stage discovery pattern
}
```
**Result**: Discovers ALL project files, extracts deep intelligence

### 2. Aero Package (RelentlessContextExtractor)
```typescript
// /Users/wolfejam/FAF/cli/src/engines/relentless-context-extractor.ts
export class RelentlessContextExtractor {
  // WHO/WHAT/WHY/WHERE/WHEN/HOW extraction
  // 3-tier confidence: CERTAIN/PROBABLE/INFERRED
  // TODO generation for missing context
}
```
**Result**: Hunts human context with surgical precision

### 3. Race Strategy (DropCoach)
```typescript
// /Users/wolfejam/FAF/cli/src/engines/drop-coach.ts
export class DropCoach {
  // Language detection (Python/Go/Rust/Java/JS)
  // TOP-6 recommendations per language
  // Milestone celebrations
}
```
**Result**: Guides users to championship context
