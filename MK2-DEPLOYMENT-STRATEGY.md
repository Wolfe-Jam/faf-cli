# 🏎️ MK2 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY - Smart Rollout Plan

## THE DECISION: Staged Deployment (Not All-In)

---

## CURRENT ENGINE MAP

### Where Each Engine Runs:

```
🌐 fafdev.tools    → MK1 (KEEP IT! Working perfectly)
📦 CLI (npm soon)  → MK2 (DEPLOY HERE! Perfect testing ground)
🔌 MCP             → MK1 (Current - stable for Claude)
🏢 Enterprise      → MK2 (Future - after CLI proves it)
```

---

## WHY THIS STRATEGY WINS

### 1. Don't Break What Works
```typescript
// fafdev.tools
const decision = {
  current: 'MK1 - 21 slots',
  status: 'PERFECT',
  users: 'Happy',
  risk: 'ZERO',
  action: 'LEAVE IT ALONE'
};
// If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
```

### 2. CLI = Perfect Testing Ground
```typescript
// CLI (going to npm)
const strategy = {
  engine: 'MK2',
  why: [
    'Power users who want features',
    'Can handle complexity',
    'Love having options',
    'Early adopters',
    'We control the updates'
  ],
  risk: 'MANAGED',
  rollback: 'Easy - just npm publish previous'
};
```

### 3. MCP Stays Stable
```typescript
// MCP (Claude integration)
const mcpStatus = {
  engine: 'MK1/Current',
  why: 'Claude needs stability',
  change: 'ONLY when MK2 proven in CLI',
  timeline: 'After 1000+ CLI users happy'
};
```

---

## THE PHASED ROLLOUT

### Phase 1: NOW - CLI Gets MK2
```bash
# npm package gets the new engine
$ npm install -g faf-cli
$ faf --version
FAF CLI v3.0.0 (Engine: MK2)

# But defaults to MK2-Core (safe mode)
$ faf score
Score: 94% (Engine: FAF-CORE-MK2)

# Power users can access other engines
$ faf score --engine hybrid
Score: 97% (Engine: HYBRID-PLATINUM)
```

### Phase 2: LATER - Proven Success
```typescript
// After 30 days of CLI success
if (cliMetrics.satisfaction > 95 && cliMetrics.bugs < 5) {
  // Consider for other platforms
  evaluateFor('fafdev.tools'); // Still probably no
  evaluateFor('mcp');          // Maybe for v2
  evaluateFor('enterprise');   // Yes, they want features
}
```

### Phase 3: FUTURE - Selective Upgrade
```yaml
fafdev.tools: MK1  # Forever? It's perfect as-is
CLI: MK2          # Full feature set
MCP: MK2-Core     # Just the reliable engine
Enterprise: MK2   # All engines for different needs
Mobile: MK1       # Simple is better on mobile
```

---

## RISK ANALYSIS

### All-In on MK2 (DON'T DO THIS)
```typescript
const allInRisks = {
  fafdev.tools: 'Could break working system',
  userReaction: 'Why did you change it?',
  mcp: 'Claude gets confused',
  rollback: 'Painful across multiple platforms',
  testing: 'Not enough data',
  verdict: 'TOO RISKY'
};
```

### Staged Deployment (DO THIS)
```typescript
const stagedBenefits = {
  risk: 'Isolated to CLI',
  testing: 'Real users, controlled environment',
  rollback: 'Simple npm publish',
  learning: 'Gather data before expanding',
  pr: 'CLI users love being first',
  verdict: 'SMART PLAY'
};
```

---

## THE CLI ADVANTAGE

### Why CLI Users Will Love MK2:

1. **They're Power Users**
   - Want more features
   - Understand complexity
   - Appreciate options

2. **They Chose CLI**
   - Already prefer command line
   - Comfortable with flags/options
   - Like control

3. **Easy Communication**
   ```bash
   $ faf score --help
   Available engines:
     --engine core     # Default, reliable (21 slots)
     --engine hybrid   # Optimal (35 fields) 
     --engine verbose  # Full analysis (admin only)
   ```

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Week 1: CLI Development
```typescript
// Build MK2 into CLI
- [ ] Create engines/mk2 directory
- [ ] Implement EngineManager
- [ ] Add --engine flag
- [ ] Default to MK2-Core
- [ ] Hide V-Score behind --admin
```

### Week 2: Testing
```typescript
// Internal testing
- [ ] Run all engines in parallel
- [ ] Verify MK2-Core = MK1 results
- [ ] Test engine swapping
- [ ] Benchmark performance
```

### Week 3: NPM Release
```bash
$ npm publish faf-cli@3.0.0
# Announcement: "Now with modular engine system!"
# Default: Same reliable scoring
# Advanced: New engine options for power users
```

### Week 4: Monitor & Iterate
```typescript
const metrics = {
  downloads: trackNpmDownloads(),
  engineUsage: {
    'mk2-core': '94%',  // Most use default
    'hybrid': '5%',     // Power users
    'v-score': '1%'     // Internal/admin
  },
  feedback: collectUserFeedback(),
  bugs: trackGitHubIssues()
};
```

---

## THE MESSAGE

### For CLI Users (npm):
"FAF CLI now features a modular engine system! Same reliable scoring by default, with advanced options for power users."

### For fafdev.tools Users:
"No changes - your experience remains perfect."

### For MCP Users:
"Stable integration continues with proven engine."

### For Investors:
"We're rolling out our advanced engine system strategically, starting with our most technical users."

---

## DECISION SUMMARY

### ✅ YES: MK2 to CLI First
- Perfect testing ground
- Power user audience
- Controlled rollout
- Easy rollback
- Learn before expanding

### ❌ NO: Don't Touch fafdev.tools
- Already perfect
- Users happy
- No need to change
- Keep MK1 forever?

### ⏸️ WAIT: MCP Stays Current
- Let CLI prove MK2
- Claude needs stability
- Upgrade only when proven

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Deploy MK2 to CLI NOW** - It's going to npm, perfect audience
**Keep MK1 on fafdev.tools** - Don't break perfection
**Keep Current on MCP** - Claude likes stability

**This is the F1 strategy:**
- Test new engines in practice (CLI)
- Keep proven engines in the race (fafdev.tools)
- Only upgrade when data proves it's better
