## 🤔 "But Lovable Already Has AI..."

**TRUE.** But here's what happens in Week 2:

1. Lovable builds your auth ✅
2. You need Stripe integration 💳
3. Lovable gives generic answer 😕
4. You copy to Claude for help 🤖
5. Claude: "What framework are you using?" 🤦
6. You: *20 minutes explaining* ⏰
7. Claude breaks something else 🔥
8. ChatGPT: "What's your app about?" 😤
9. **ENDLESS PAIN LOOP** 🔄

### ONE `.faf` file makes your project work with:
- ✅ **Claude** (for architecture decisions)
- ✅ **ChatGPT** (for debugging)
- ✅ **Cursor** (for refactoring)
- ✅ **v0.dev** (for UI components)
- ✅ **Perplexity** (for research)
- ✅ **ANY AI TOOL** (present and future)

### Without FAF VIBE:
```yaml
Time per AI switch: 20 minutes explaining
AIs that understand your project: 0
Frustration level: 😤😤😤😤😤
```

### With FAF VIBE:
```yaml
Time per AI switch: 0 seconds
AIs that understand your project: ALL OF THEM
Shipping velocity: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
```

## 🤔 FAQs

### "Why not just stay in Lovable?"
Lovable is AMAZING for starting. But real apps need real debugging, real architecture decisions, and access to specialized AI tools. FAF VIBE is your bridge.

### "What if I graduate to pro development?"
Your FAF grows with you! Start at $9, upgrade to $100 Pro when you're ready.

### "Why won't Lovable/Replit build this?"
They want lock-in to their AI. We want you to have freedom to use the best AI for each task.

### "Is this just for beginners?"
No! It's for anyone who values their time. Even pros use Lovable for rapid prototyping.
